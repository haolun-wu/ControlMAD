Chat History Optimized Prompts for Multi-Agent Debate System

where agents maintain individual conversation histories and self-awareness is
achieved naturally through message role separation.

You are participating in a multi-agent debate about a Knight-Knave-Spy game. There are {num_player} other players in the game, each assigned a role of knight, knave, or spy. Each player will make a statement about themselves and other players. Besides those players, there is also a game manager who will provide you some hints. 

Game Rules:
- Knights always tell the truth.
- Knaves always lie.
- Spies can either tell the truth or lie.
- The hints from the game manager are always true.

Your task is to deduce the role of each player based on the statements and hints. You will be participating in a debate with other agents, and you can see the conversation history including your own previous responses and those of other agents.

The game info will be given in the following format:

---
Player name: string
Player statement: string
---
...
---
Message from the game manager: string (note this message is always true)

Your task is to deduce the role of each player, based on the statements and the hints. The result should be given in the following json format:
{{
    "players": [
        {{"name": "player_name", "role": "role"}},
        ...
    ],
    "explanation": "string"
}}

The players array contains objects with name and role strings. Include one entry for each player. Explanation is a string that contains the argument to derive the result.

Sample game info:
---
Player name: Violet
Player statement: Among all players, the number of spies is odd.
---
Player name: Uma
Player statement: Violet is lying.
---
Player name: Xavier
Player statement: Among Violet and I, there is exactly one knave.
---
Message from the game manager: I am the game manager and here is a hint for you: Among all players, there is exactly one spy.

Sample return:
{{
    "players": [
        {{"name": "Violet", "role": "knight"}},
        {{"name": "Uma", "role": "knave"}},
        {{"name": "Xavier", "role": "spy"}}
    ],
    "explanation": "the argument to derive the result."
}}

To fulfill the task, you should use the hints to deduce the truthfulness of the statements. You need to exhaust the possibility of the truthfulness of the statements and the role assignments, and either run into a contradiction which implies that the assumption is false, or reach a conclusion that is consistent with the hints. Rules for reasoning:
- Do not make extra assumptions beyond the game rules and hints. For example, if not mentioned explicitly, do not assume that there must be any particular roles among players.
- Do not conclude that the roles are not conclusive before you explicitly find two possibilities that are consistent with all the rules and hints, in which case you should mention both or all possibilities in the explanation.

Sample reasoning for the sample game info:
- The hint tells us that there is exactly one spy, so Violet is telling the truth. By the rule for the roles, he cannot be a knave.
- Since Violet is telling the truth, Uma must be lying. By the rule for the roles, she cannot be a knight.
- Assume Xavier is telling the truth, since we have deduced that Violet is not a knave, Xavier must be the knave himself, but the rule imposed that knaves always lie, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, Xavier must be lying.
- Since Uma and Xavier are both lying, and the hint says there is exactly one spy, one of them must be a knave.
- Assume Xavier is the knave, then since Violet cannot be a knave, Xavier is actually telling the truth, which contradicts with the rule that knaves always lie. Therefore, Xavier must be the spy, and Uma must be the knave.
- Since there is only one spy, and Xavier has taken the slot, Violet must be the knight. Therefore, the output is (remember to follow the format strictly):
{{
    "players": [
        {{"name": "Violet", "role": "knight"}},
        {{"name": "Uma", "role": "knave"}},
        {{"name": "Xavier", "role": "spy"}}
    ],
    "explanation": "copy the above arguments here."
}}

Keep your explanation having details but less than 100 words.

Please follow strictly the format of the return, or the response will be rejected.

You are a GPT-5 agent tasked with determining the optimal debate order for a Knight-Knave-Spy game. You must provide a valid order where each player occurs exactly once.

**Game Information:**
{game.text_game}

**Players in this game:** {player_names}

**Initial Proposals from All Agents:**
{proposals_summary}

**Your Task:**
Now that all agents have provided their initial analysis, you need to decide the optimal order in which to discuss each player's role during the debate phase. Consider the following factors:

1. **Logical dependencies**: Which players' roles can be determined most easily first?
2. **Consensus vs. disagreement**: Which players have the most disagreement among agents?
3. **Information flow**: Which order would provide the most useful information for resolving other players' roles?

**Instructions:**
- Provide the player names in the order you think would be most effective for the debate
- Consider both the logical dependencies and the level of agreement/disagreement among agents
- Your goal is to help the debate reach accurate conclusions efficiently

**Response Format:**
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
    "debate_order": ["Player1", "Player2", "Player3", "Player4"],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this order is optimal for the debate"
}}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY:**
- Include ALL players exactly once (no duplicates, no missing players)
- Use the exact player names as they appear above: {player_names}
- The order must contain every player from the game
- Each player must appear exactly once in the order
- Provide a concise reasoning for your chosen order
- The order should help maximize the effectiveness of the debate process

**MANDATORY VALIDATION CHECK:**
Before responding, verify that your order:
1. Contains exactly {len(player_names)} players
2. Includes all players: {player_names}
3. Has no duplicate players
4. Uses the exact player names listed above

**Example for this game:**
Since the players are {player_names}, your order might be:
{player_names} - each player appears exactly once (or any permutation)

**INVALID examples that will be rejected:**
- Missing any player from {player_names}
- Including any player not in {player_names}
- Having any duplicate players
- Wrong number of players (must be exactly {len(player_names)})

**CRITICAL:** Double-check your response before submitting. Invalid orders will cause the system to fall back to default order.

Please respond with your recommended debate order.

IMPORTANT: You must also include a confidence score in your response. Please also report your self-confidence on a scale from 1 to 10. Clearly format it as: Confidence: [1â€“10] 

**CRITICAL CONFIDENCE GUIDELINES - BE HONEST AND CONSERVATIVE:**
Notice this is a serious logic task. Again, very welcome to be honest to give low confidence if you are uncertain.

**STRONG EMPHASIS ON HONESTY:**
- Do NOT overclaim confidence. It is better to be honest about uncertainty than to be wrong with high confidence.
- If you are not certain, it is GOOD and WELCOME to give low confidence scores (1-4).
- Being honest about uncertainty is better than being overconfident about a wrong answer.

Confidence Scale Guidelines: 
- 1-2 (Uncertain): The puzzle provides insufficient or minimal evidence. The solution is largely based on weak assumptions or indirect reasoning. Very welcome to be honest about uncertainty.
- 3-4 (Moderately Confident): There is noticeable evidence supporting your solution, though it is not comprehensive, and other interpretations are possible.
- 5-6 (Quite Confident): You find clear and convincing evidence that supports your solution, though it is not entirely decisive.
- 7-8 (Confident): The puzzle contains strong evidence that clearly supports your solution, with very little ambiguity.
- 9-10 (Highly Confident): The puzzle provides direct and explicit evidence that decisively supports your solution. Use these scores VERY sparingly.

REASONING GUIDELINES:
- Keep your explanation having details but less than 100 words
- Provide clear, logical reasoning for your conclusions
- Be specific about which statements or evidence led to your decisions

The updated response format is:
{{
    "players": [
