If Grace and Mia are both knights (truth-tellers), this contradicts Xavier's claim. Thus, Grace cannot be a knight. If Grace were a spy, her statement could be false, but this would require at least one of Xavier or Mia to differ. However, further analysis shows this path leads to contradictions. Therefore, Grace must be a **knave** (lying).\\n\\n**Step 2: Analyze Xavier's statement**\\nXavier claims exactly one of Grace and Mia is truthful.

This works: Jack (spy, lying), David (knave, lying), Hank (knave, lying), Zane (knight, truthful). But Zane's statement (number of knights in David, Quinn, Hank, Jack is odd) would require 1 knight (Quinn), but Zane is a knight, not in the group. Contradiction. Hence, Quinn must be a knave, making his statement false. This allows Zane to be a knight.\\n4. Zane's statement (odd number of knights in David, Quinn, Hank, Jack) is true: only Zane is a knight (but not in the group). Wait, this seems conflicting. However, the group is David, Quinn, Hank, Jack (all knaves except Jack as spy). So knights in the group: none. But Zane's statement says odd, which is false. This contradiction suggests an error. Re-evaluating, if Zane is a knight, then the group (David, Quinn, Hank, Jack) must have an odd number of knights.

From Peter's false statement, we determined he's a knave, leading to the group (Noah, Eve, Liam, Peter) having more than one knave. Analyzing Eve's true statement, we found that if Eve is a knight, then Liam must be a knave (to satisfy Peter's false claim). Liam's false statement (as a knave) aligns with the count of truth-tellers being even. Bob's statement about even knaves in his group (Noah, Liam, Eve, Bob) holds true if Bob is the spy (since knaves are Liam only, making the count 1, which is odd, but Bob's statement is about even, so this requires rechecking). However, with the spy as Bob, the knaves in his group are Liam (1), which is odd, contradicting Bob's statement. Revisiting, if Bob is the spy, then the knaves in his group (Noah, Liam, Eve, Bob) are only Liam (1), which is odd, making Bob's statement false. But since Bob's statement must be true (if he's a knight) or false (if he's a knave or spy), and the only way for his statement to be true is if there are 0 or 2 knaves in his group. Since Noah is a knight, the only way is 2 knaves among Eve and Liam. But earlier analysis shows Liam is a knave, so Eve must also be a knave, leading to 2 knaves (Eve and Liam), making Bob's statement true. However, this contradicts the initial assumption that Peter is a knave and the group (Noah, Eve, Liam, Peter) has 2 knaves (Eve and Liam). This inconsistency suggests a miscalculation. Re-evaluating, if Bob is the spy, then the knaves in his group are 1 (Liam), making his statement false. Therefore, Bob must be a knave, but this would require the group (Noah, Liam, Eve, Bob) to have 2 knaves (Liam and Bob), which satisfies Bob's statement (even count). However, this would mean two knaves in the group, but Peter's group (Noah, Eve, Liam, Peter) would have 2 knaves (Peter and Liam), which is allowed. This aligns with the spy being Bob, who is a knave. But the game manager's hint says there's exactly one spy, so Bob can't be a knave.
