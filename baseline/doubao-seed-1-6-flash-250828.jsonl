(2) Among all players, there is exactly one spy.' Since the game manager confirms (2) is true (exactly one spy), Wendy's statement that 'exactly one is true' implies (1) must be false (otherwise both (1) and (2) would be true). Thus, (1) is false: Hank, Violet, Tina, and Wendy do not all have the same role.\\n\\n### Step 2: Tina's Statement\\nTina claims: 'Among the following two statements, exactly one is true: (1) Hank is a knight. (2) Hank and I have the same role.' Let's denote T1 = (Hank is knight) and T2 = (Hank and Tina have the same role). Tina's statement is T1 XOR T2 (exactly one true).\\n\\n### Step 3: Violet's Statement\\nViolet claims: 'Wendy, Tina, Sam, and Hank all have the same role.' Since Wendy is not a spy (we later confirm she is a knight), and there is only one spy, Violet's statement is false (as not all four can share the same role). Thus, Violet is either a knave (always lies) or a spy. But we later rule out Violet as spy (Case 3).\\n\\n### Step 4: Hank's Statement\\nHank claims: 'Violet and Tina are either both telling truth or both lying.' This is equivalent to (Violet_truth ↔ Tina_truth).\\n\\n### Step 5: Testing Spy Candidates\\nWe test each player as the spy (only one spy allowed):\\n- **Case 1: Tina is spy** → Contradictions in Hank and Tina's statements.\\n- **Case 2: Sam is spy** → Contradictions in Tina and Sam's statements.\\n- **Case 3: Violet is spy** → Contradictions in Hank and Violet's statements.\\n- **Case 4: Hank is spy** → Consistent:\\n  - **Tina**: Since Hank is spy (not knight), T1 is false. T2 (Hank and Tina same role) is false (Hank=spy, Tina=knave/knave). Thus, T1 XOR T2 = false, so Tina lies → Tina is knave.\\n  - **Violet**: Knave (lies, as her statement is false).\\n  - **Sam**: Knave (lies, as his statement 'exactly one true' is false: both his S1 and S2 are true).\\n  - **Wendy**: Knight (truth-teller, as her statement is true: only (2) is true).\\n  - **Hank**: Spy (can tell truth: Violet and Tina are both knaves, so 'both lying' is true).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe only consistent roles are Tina=knave, Sam=knave, Violet=knave, Hank=spy, Wendy=knight.\\n\",\n\"confidence\": 100\n}", "usage": {"input": 0, "output": 0, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 0}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

(2) false implies Liam, Mia, Xavier all have the same role. Since Xavier is a knight, Liam and Mia would also be knights, making K=3 (contradicts K=2).\\n  - If (2) is true, then (1) is false (K≠2). But (2) true means Liam, Mia, Xavier do not all have the same role. Since Xavier is a knight, Liam and Mia must be non-knights (knave or spy). With K=1 (only Xavier), Violet, Olivia, Liam, Mia are knaves or spy. However, Violet's statement would then be true (she is knave, so must lie), leading to a contradiction. Thus, Xavier cannot be a knight.\\n- If Xavier is a spy, his statement could be true or false. However, (1) (K=2) would require Liam and Mia to be spies (impossible, only one spy), and (2) (Liam, Mia, Xavier not all same role) is always true (Xavier is spy). Thus, (1) false, (2) true, making Xavier's statement false (needs exactly one true), which is possible but leads to contradictions with other statements (e.g., Liam's statement is false, but knights/knaves roles don't fit).\\n- If Xavier is a knave, his statement is false: either both (1) and (2) are true or both are false.\\n  - Both true: (1) K=2 and (2) true. But (2) true implies Liam, Mia, Xavier not all same role. Xavier is knave, so Liam/Mia can't be knaves (all same role), making them knights. K=3 (Xavier=knave, Liam, Mia=knights) contradicts K=2.\\n  - Both false: (1) K≠2 and (2) false. (2) false implies Liam, Mia, Xavier all same role. Since Xavier is knave, Liam and Mia must also be knaves. Now, we have 3 knaves (Xavier, Liam, Mia). Remaining players: Violet, Olivia. Hint says 1 spy, so one is spy, the other is knight.

Thus, Violet=knave, leaving Olivia=spy.\\n\\n### Step 2: Verify All Roles\\n- Xavier=knave, Liam=knave, Mia=knave, Violet=knave, Olivia=spy (1 spy, 4 knaves, 0 knights).\\n- Xavier (knave): Both (1) (K=2) and (2) (not all same role) false → statement false (consistent).\\n- Violet (knave): Claims \\\"not all same role\\\"—false (all knaves) → statement false (consistent).\\n- Olivia (spy): Claims \\\"Liam and Mia are knaves\\\"—true (allowed for spy).\\n- Mia (knave): Claims \\\"Violet and I have different roles\\\"—false (both knaves) → statement false (consistent).\\n- Liam (knave): Claims \\\"Olivia, Xavier, I are knights\\\"—false (Olivia=spy, others knaves) → statement false (consistent).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe only consistent assignment is Xavier, Violet, Liam, Mia as knaves and Olivia as spy.\",\n\"confidence\": 100\n}", "usage": {"input": 0, "output": 0, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 0}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

We consider two cases:\\n- **Case 1: Yara is a knave** → Knaves always lie, so her statement would be false. But if she's a knave, her statement 'I am a knave' would be true, a contradiction. Thus, Yara cannot be a knave.\\n- **Case 2: Yara is a knight** → Knights always tell the truth, so her statement 'I am a knave' would be true, meaning she is a knave. Contradiction again. Thus, Yara cannot be a knight.\\nSince Yara cannot be a knave or knight, she must be the spy (the only remaining role). This satisfies the hint that there is exactly one spy, so Yara = spy.\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze Grace's statement\\nGrace says, 'Frank, Yara, Kate, and I all have the same role.' Since Yara is the spy, the roles of Frank, Yara, Kate, and Grace include a spy (Yara). For all four to have the same role, Frank, Kate, and Grace would also need to be spies, but there is only one spy (Yara). Thus, Grace's statement is false. Since Yara is the only spy, Grace cannot be a spy, so Grace must be a knave (knaves lie). Thus, Grace = knave.\\n\\n### Step 3: Analyze Frank's statement\\nFrank says, 'Grace, Kate, and I are all knights.' We already know Grace is a knave, so Frank's statement is false (since Grace is not a knight). Since Yara is the only spy, Frank cannot be a spy, so Frank must be a knave (knaves lie). Thus, Frank = knave.\\n\\n### Step 4: Analyze Kate's statement\\nKate says, 'Grace, Mia, Yara, Frank, and I do not all have the same role.' The group includes Grace (knave), Mia (unknown), Yara (spy), Frank (knave), and Kate (unknown). Since Yara is a spy, the group cannot all have the same role (spies ≠ knaves). Thus, Kate's statement is true, so Kate must be a knight (knights tell the truth). Thus, Kate = knight.\\n\\n### Step 5: Analyze Mia's statement\\nMia says, 'Among Frank, Yara, Kate, and I, the number of spies is even.' The group includes Frank (knave), Yara (spy), Kate (knight), and Mia (unknown). Since there is only one spy (Yara), the number of spies in this group is 1 (odd). Mia's statement claims this number is even, so her statement is false. Since Yara is the only spy, Mia cannot be a spy, so Mia must be a knave (knaves lie). Thus, Mia = knave.\\n\\nAll roles are consistent with the rules and hint.

This means 4 players are either knights or knaves, with knights always telling the truth, knaves always lying, and spies able to tell truth or lie.\\n\\n### Step 1: Analyze Frank and Grace's statements\\n- Frank claims, \\\"Among all players, the number of knights is odd.\\\" If Frank were telling the truth, the number of knights would be odd (1, 3, or 5). However, since there is 1 spy, 5 knights is impossible, leaving 1 or 3 knights. Grace claims, \\\"Frank is telling the truth.\\\" If Frank is truthful, Grace must also be truthful (knight or spy). But testing these cases leads to contradictions (e.g., Charlie would have to be both a knave and tell the truth, which is impossible). Thus, Frank must be lying, so the number of knights is even (0, 2, 4).\\n- Since Frank is lying, Grace's claim \\\"Frank is telling the truth\\\" is also false, so Grace is lying (knave or spy). With Frank lying, Frank cannot be a knight. If Frank were a spy, Grace would have to be a knave (only 1 spy), leaving 3 knights (odd), contradicting Frank's lie. Thus, Frank and Grace are both knaves (2 knaves), leaving 1 spy and 2 knights (even, satisfying Frank's lie).\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze Xavier, David, and Charlie\\n- Xavier claims, \\\"Charlie, Grace, and Frank all have the same role.\\\" Grace and Frank are knaves, so Xavier is claiming Charlie is also a knave. If Xavier were a knight, Charlie would have to be a knave, but there are only 2 knaves (Frank, Grace), so Charlie would be a knight, making Xavier's statement false (contradiction). Thus, Xavier must be lying (knave or spy). Since there are only 2 knaves, Xavier cannot be a knave, so Xavier is the spy.\\n- David and Charlie are now knights (2 knights, even). David claims, \\\"Exactly one of (1) and (2) is true: (1) Xavier and Grace are both lying; (2) Among Frank and Grace, exactly one is lying.\\\" (1) Xavier (spy, lied) and Grace (knave, lied) are both lying, so (1) is true. (2) Frank and Grace are both knaves (lying), so \\\"exactly one lying\\\" is false. Thus, exactly one true statement (1), so David tells the truth (knight, consistent).\\n- Charlie, a knight, claims, \\\"Among Frank, Xavier, and Grace, exactly one person is lying.\\\" Frank (knave, lied), Xavier (spy, lied), and Grace (knave, lied) are all lying, so Charlie's statement is false. This contradicts Charlie being a knight. Thus, the earlier assumption of 2 knights is invalid.\\n\\n### Step 3: Revise to 0 knights\\n- If there are 0 knights (even, satisfying Frank's lie), all 4 non-spy players are knaves. The spy must be Xavier (only remaining player who can lie or tell truth). This works: Xavier (spy) tells the truth (Charlie, Grace, Frank are all knaves), and all others (knights=0, knaves=4, spy=1) satisfy the rules.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe roles are: Frank=knave, Grace=knave, Xavier=spy, David=knave, Charlie=knave.\",\n\"confidence\": 100\n}", "usage": {"input": 0, "output": 0, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 0}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}
