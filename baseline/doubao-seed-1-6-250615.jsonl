They can't all be spies (only 1). If all knights: Tina's (1) 'Hank is knight' (true), (2) 'Hank=Tina' (true) → Tina's statement 'exactly one true' is false (contradicts Tina=knight). If all knaves: Tina's (1) false, (2) true (Hank=Tina=knave) → Tina's statement 'exactly one true' is true (contradicts Tina=knave). Thus Violet cannot be knight.\\n\\nStep 3: Assume Violet is knave (liar). Then W,T,S,H not all same role. Hank's statement: 'Violet and Tina both truthful or both lying.' Since Violet is knave (lying), Hank's statement simplifies to 'Tina is lying.'\\n\\nStep 4: Analyze Hank's role (Violet=knave, so spy is T/S/H/W):\\n- If Hank=knight: Hank tells truth → Tina lying. Tina's statement false: 0/2 true. Tina's (1) 'Hank=knight' (true), (2) 'Hank=Tina' (false, Tina lying≠knight). So exactly one true → Tina's statement true (contradicts Tina lying). Thus Hank≠knight.\\n- If Hank=knave: Hank lies → Tina truthful. Tina's statement true: exactly one true. Tina's (1) 'Hank=knight' (false, Hank=knave), so (2) must be true → 'Hank=Tina' (Hank=knave → Tina=knave), but Tina truthful contradicts knave.

Now: Violet=knave, Hank=spy.\\n\\nStep 5: Tina's role (not spy):\\n- If Tina=knight (truthful): Tina's statement 'exactly one true.' (1) 'Hank=knight' (false, spy), so (2) must be true → 'Hank=Tina' (spy vs knight: false). 0 true → Tina's statement false (contradicts knight). Thus Tina=knave (liar).\\n\\nStep 6: Wendy's role (not spy):\\n- Wendy's statement: 'exactly one of (1) H,V,T,W same role; (2) exactly one spy.' (2) is true (game manager).

But H=spy≠others → (1) false. Contradiction. Thus Wendy=knight.\\n\\nStep 7: Sam's role (not spy):\\n- Sam's statement: 'exactly one of (1) V,T,Sam same role; (2) number of knaves odd.' V=knave, T=knave. If Sam=knight (truthful): (1) false (Sam=knight≠knaves), (2) 2 knaves (even) → false. 0 true → Sam's statement false (contradicts knight).

If Grace were a knave, her statement would be false, meaning she and Noah have the same role (Noah is also knave).

Tina's statement (\\\"exactly one knight in Grace, Noah, Frank, Tina\\\") would require only Grace as knight. If Tina is knave (lying), Frank must be knight. Frank's statement (\\\"even truth-tellers in Noah, Tina, Grace\\\") would be false (Noah/ Tina lie, Grace tells truth: 1 truth-teller, odd), contradicting Frank as knight.

Quinn (knight) claims \\\"exactly one of (1) Sam is spy, (2) Tina, Eve, Grace, Quinn not all same role.\\\" (1) False (Tina is spy), (2) True (roles are spy, knave, knave, knight). Thus, exactly one true → Quinn's statement true (correct). Sam's statement: if Sam is knight, 2 knights (even) → false (contradiction). If Sam is knave, 1 knight (odd) → true (contradiction).

Grace's statement: \\\"Tina, Eve, Sam all same role.\\\"\\n\\nSubcase 2a: Grace is knight. Then Tina, Eve, Sam are same role (knave, since Tina is knave). Eve (knave) lies about \\\"Grace and Quinn same role\\\" → Quinn is not knight (spy/knave). If Quinn is knave, no spy (contradiction). If Quinn is spy, Sam (knave) claims \\\"number of knights is odd\\\" (1 knight: Grace, odd) → Sam's statement true (contradiction, knave must lie). Thus, Grace cannot be knight.\\n\\nSubcase 2b: Grace is knave. Her statement is false → Tina, Eve, Sam are not all same role (Tina is knave, so Eve/Sam not both knaves). Eve's statement: \\\"Grace and Quinn same role.\\\"\\n\\n- If Eve is knave: her statement is false → Quinn is not knave (spy/knight). Tina, Grace, Eve are knaves. Sam can't be knave (Grace's false statement), so Sam is knight/spy. If Sam is knight, \\\"number of knights is odd\\\" (needs 1 knight: Sam). Quinn would be spy. But Tina (knave) claims \\\"Eve, Grace, Tina all same role\\\" (true, all knaves) → contradiction (knave must lie).\\n\\n- If Eve is knight: her statement is true → Quinn is knave (same as Grace). Now, Tina (knave), Grace (knave), Quinn (knave). Grace's false statement: Tina, Eve, Sam not all same (Tina=knave, Eve=knight, so Sam can't be both). Sam must be spy (only remaining role). Check Sam (spy) statement: \\\"number of knights is odd\\\" (1 knight: Eve, true → allowed). Quinn (knave) statement: \\\"exactly one of (1) Sam is spy (true), (2) Tina, Eve, Grace, Quinn not all same (true).\\\" Both true → Quinn's statement false (correct, knave lies).

His statement 'Charlie, Grace, Frank same role' → Grace=V, Frank=V, so if Charlie=V, statement is true (Spy can tell truth). Thus, Charlie=V. David=V (only role left). Now knights=0 (even, consistent with Frank's lie). Check David's statement (V=liar): 'exactly one of (1) and (2) true'. (1) Xavier (Spy=truth) and Grace (V=lie) both lying? False. (2) Frank (V=lie) and Grace (V=lie) exactly one lying? False. So David's statement is false (correct, V). Charlie's statement (V=liar): 'exactly one lying among Frank, Xavier, Grace' → Frank=V (lie), Xavier=Spy (truth), Grace=V (lie) → 2 liars. Statement false (correct, V).

Xavier's statement false (Grace=K, Frank=Spy) → Xavier=V. Charlie/David=K (knights=3). David's statement 'exactly one of (1)/(2) true' → (1) Xavier=V (lie), Grace=K (truth) → false; (2) Frank=truth, Grace=K (truth) → false. David's statement false → David=V, contradiction. If Frank=lie (knights even), Grace=V (lie). Xavier=V (statement false). Charlie/David=K (knights=2). Charlie's statement 'exactly one lying among Frank, Xavier, Grace' → 3 liars → false, contradiction.

Thus, David cannot be a knight and must be either a knave or the spy.\\n\\n### Case 1: David is a knave\\nIf David is a knave, his statement is false, so not all of Jack, Quinn, Hank, David are knaves (consistent, as David is a knave but at least one other is not).\\n\\n#### Substep 1a: Analyze Jack's statement\\nJack claims, \\\"David, Zane, Quinn, and I all have the same role.\\\" If Jack were a knight, David (knave), Zane, Quinn, and Jack would all need to be knaves (contradiction, since Jack would be a knight).

Thus, Hank cannot be a knight and must be a knave or the spy.\\n\\n#### Substep 1c: Analyze Zane's statement\\nZane claims, \\\"Among David, Quinn, Hank, and Jack, the number of knights is odd.\\\" Since David, Jack, and Hank are non-knights (from above), the only possible knight in this group is Quinn. If Zane were a knight, the number of knights would be 1 (odd), making Zane’s statement true. But then Quinn (knight) would claim, \\\"Jack, Zane, Hank, and David are all truth-tellers or all liars.\\\" Jack/Hank/David are liars (knaves), Zane is a truth-teller (knight) → not all truth or all lies, so Quinn’s statement would be false (contradiction, as Quinn is a knight). Thus, Zane cannot be a knight and must be a knave.\\n\\n#### Substep 1d: Zane is a knave, so his statement is false\\nZane’s false statement means the number of knights in {David, Quinn, Hank, Jack} is even (0, 2, 4).

Thus, Quinn is not a knight.\\n\\n#### Substep 1e: Identify the spy\\nWith David/Jack/Hank/Zane as non-knights (only one spy allowed), the remaining player (Quinn) must be the spy. This leaves Jack/Hank/Zane as knaves (since only one spy exists).\\n\\n### Case 2: David is the spy\\nIf David is the spy, his statement (\\\"all knaves\\\") is false (since he is a spy, not a knave). Then Jack/Hank/Zane/Quinn are knights or knaves. Jack’s statement (all same role) is false (David is spy), so Jack is a knave. Hank’s statement (all same role) is false (Jack is knave), so Hank is a knave. Zane/Quinn must be knights or knaves. If Zane were a knight, his statement (odd knights in {David, Quinn, Hank, Jack}) would require Quinn to be a knight (1 knight, odd).

If Zane were a knave, his statement (even knights) would require 0 knights, making Quinn a knave. But Quinn (knave) would claim Jack/Zane/Hank/David are all liars (true), contradicting knaves’ requirement to lie.

If Jack is truthful (knight), his statement about even knights in his group leads to a contradiction (Quinn can't be knight/knave).

Liam says, 'I am a knave.' If Liam were a knight, he would tell the truth, implying he is a knave (contradiction). If Liam were a knave, he would lie, implying he is not a knave (contradiction). Thus, Liam must be the spy (only remaining role, and spies can lie).\\n\\nStep 2: Analyze Bob's statement. Bob says, 'Liam and I have the same role.' Since Liam is the spy (only spy), Bob’s claim is false. Bob cannot be the spy (Liam is), so Bob must be a knave (knaves always lie).\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze Zane's statement. Zane says, 'Ivy, Bob, and I are all knights.' Bob is already a knave, so Zane’s statement is false. Zane cannot be the spy (Liam is), so Zane must be a knave (knaves always lie).\\n\\nStep 4: Analyze Ivy's statement. Ivy says, 'Among all players, the number of knaves is odd.' Current knaves: Bob and Zane (2, even). For Ivy’s statement to be true (if she is a knight), there must be 3 knaves (odd). The only remaining player is Noah, so Noah would need to be the third knave. However, Noah’s statement would then be false (since knaves lie).\\n\\nStep 5: Analyze Noah's statement. Noah says, 'Among Ivy, Bob, and Liam, the number of people who are lying is even.' If Noah were a knave (third knave), his statement would be false, meaning the number of liars is odd. But Ivy (knight, truthful), Bob (knave, lying), Liam (spy, lying) → 2 liars (even), contradicting Noah’s lie. Thus, Noah cannot be a knave.\\n\\nStep 6: Resolve contradictions. Since Noah cannot be a knave, the number of knaves remains 2 (Bob, Zane, even). Ivy’s statement ('number of knaves is odd') is therefore false. But Ivy cannot be a knave (as that would make 3 knaves, odd, making her statement true). Thus, Ivy must be a knight, and the only way to reconcile is that Noah is a knight (truthful).

Thus Bob cannot be spy, so Bob=knight.\\nStep 3: Bob=knight (truth-teller), so exactly one spy among Alice/Peter/Violet/Liam.\\nCase 2: Spy=Alice. Then Violet's statement (Alice=Peter) is false (Alice=spy≠Peter), so Violet=knave. Peter's statement (exactly one knight in {Peter,Bob,Violet,Liam}) requires Peter/Violet/Liam=non-knight. Peter=knight→contradiction, so Peter=knave. Then Peter's statement false→knights in {Peter,Bob,Violet,Liam}≠1. Bob=knight, so Liam=knight (only possibility). Liam=knight→Peter=Violet=Liam=knight→Peter=knight contradicts Peter=knave. Case 2 invalid.\\nCase 3: Spy=Peter. Then Violet's statement (Alice=Peter=spy) is false→Violet=knave. Liam's statement (Peter=Violet=Liam) is false (Peter=spy≠Violet/Liam)→Liam=knave. Peter=spy can tell truth: his statement (exactly one knight in {Peter,Bob,Violet,Liam}) is true (Bob=knight, others non-knight). Alice is knight/knave. Alice=knight: (1) knaves in {Alice,Bob,Peter,Violet}=Violet=1 (odd)→false; (2) knights in {Alice,Bob,Violet,Liam}=Alice+Bob=2 (even)→false; (1) XOR (2)=false→Alice=knight must tell truth→contradiction. Alice=knave: (1) knaves in {Alice,Bob,Peter,Violet}=Alice+Violet=2 (even)→true; (2) knights in {Alice,Bob,Violet,Liam}=Bob=1 (odd)→true; (1) XOR (2)=false→Alice=knave lies→valid.\\nCase 4: Spy=Violet. Violet=spy, so her statement (Alice=Peter) can be false. Peter's statement requires Peter/Violet/Liam=non-knight. Peter=knight→contradiction, so Peter=knave. Peter's statement false→Liam=knight. Liam=knight→Peter=Violet=Liam=knight→Peter=knight contradicts Peter=knave. Case 4 invalid.\\nCase 5: Spy=Liam. Liam=spy, statement false. Peter's statement requires Peter/Violet=non-knight→Peter=knave. Peter's statement false→Violet=knight. Violet=knight→Alice=Peter=knave. Alice=knave: (1) knaves in {Alice,Bob,Peter,Violet}=2 (even)→true; (2) knights in {Alice,Bob,Violet,Liam}=2 (even)→false; (1) XOR (2)=true→Alice=knave must lie→contradiction. Case 5 invalid.\\nOnly Case 3 (Peter=spy) works: Alice=knave, Bob=knight, Peter=spy, Violet=knave, Liam=knave.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1447, "output": 7484, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 8931}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}
