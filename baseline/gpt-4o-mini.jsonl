We will examine each player's statements to find contradictions and establish identities.\\n\\n2. **Tina's Statement:** 'Among the following two statements, exactly one is true: (1). Hank is a knight. (2). Hank and I have the same role.'  \\n   - If **Tina is telling the truth**, then exactly one of the statements must be true. If (1) is true (Hank is a knight), then (2) must be false, meaning Hank and Tina have different roles. This implies Tina is a knave. This is a contradiction; therefore, Tina cannot be a knight, which means she must be a knave.\\n   - Since Tina is a knave, both of her statements must be false. Thus, Hank is not a knight and she and Hank do not have the same role. Therefore, **Hank must be a knight**.\\n\\n3. **Hank's Statement:** 'Violet and Tina are either both telling truth or both lying.'  \\n   - Since Tina is a knave (and thus lying), Hank's statement must be true, which implies **Violet is also lying**. Therefore, Violet must also be a knave.\\n\\n4. **Violet's Statement:** 'Wendy, Tina, Sam, and Hank all have the same role.'  \\n   - Since Violet is a knave, this statement is false. This means at least one of Wendy, Tina, or Sam must be of a different role than Hank (who is a knight) or Tina (who is a knave). Since Tina is a knave, this means Wendy cannot be a knight and must be a knave as well.\\n\\n5. **Wendy's Statement:** 'Among the following two statements, exactly one is true: (1). Hank, Violet, Tina, and I all have the same role. (2). Among all players, there is exactly one spy.'  \\n   - Since Wendy is a knave, both statements are false. If (1) is false, it confirms that at least one in the set (Hank, Violet, Tina, Wendy) is of a different role. This is reinforced by confirming that Hank is a knight and Tina, Violet, and Wendy are knaves. Therefore statement (2), stating there is exactly one spy, conflicts as she herself is lying.\\n\\n6. **Sam's Statement:** 'Among the following two statements, exactly one is true: (1). Violet, Tina, and I all have the same role. (2). Among all players, the number of knaves is odd.'  \\n   - If Sam is the only spy, then he can either be telling the truth or lying. We deduce that if statement (1) is true (all have the same role), then he would also have to be a knave, which is a contradiction to his uncertainty as a spy or knight.\\n   - Hence, it validates that Sam must either be a spy now because we have no other roles remaining.  \\n   - Assuming (1) is false leads that statement (2) must be true given the odd number of knaves counting Tina, Violet, Wendy (3), making Sam the spy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we verified through the assertions made by each player and deduced the roles between them based on the wording and their truth or fabrication, reaching to determine that:\\n- Tina is a **knave**.\\n- Hank is a **knight**.\\n- Sam is a **spy**.\\n- Violet is a **knave**.\\n- Wendy is a **knave**.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1180, "output": 870, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 2050}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

This means the rest must be knights or knaves. \\n\\n1. **Analyze Grace's statement**: Grace claims that among Wendy, Liam, Noah, and herself, the number of spies is odd. If we assume Grace is a knight (truth-teller), then the total number of spies among the four must be 1 or 3. If she is a knave (liar), then the number of spies must be even. \\n\\n2. **Consider Noah's claim**: Noah states that Liam and Grace have the same role. This can help narrow down roles based on Grace's credibility. If Noah is telling the truth, both Grace and Liam should be both knights or both knaves. On the other hand, if Noah is lying, one will be a knight and the other a knave.\\n\\n3. **Considering Liam's statement**: Liam says that among David, Grace, and himself, there are exactly two knaves. If this is true, then either he or Grace could be the knight in this trio but not both since two knaves cannot both be knights.\\n\\n4. **David's statement**: David says that among Grace, Liam, and Noah, exactly two people are telling the truth. This implies that if David is a knight, then exactly two of Grace, Liam, and Noah must be telling the truth. If David is a knave, less than two or all of them are telling the truth.\\n\\nNext, I analyze Wendy's statement about the truthfulness of two sub-statements:\\n1. If Wendy's first sub-statement is true, then the number of people telling the truth is even among Noah, Grace, and Liam. If that’s the case, her second claim about David and Grace having the same role must be false.\\n2. If Wendy’s first sub-statement is false, the opposite is true, and one of Grace, Liam, or Noah must be a knight, making her statement about David's role potentially true.\\n\\n5. **Cross-referencing claims**: Given that there is only one spy and we analyze that David and Grace might be the knights. \\n\\n- **Assume Grace is a knight**, meaning her statement about the odd number of spies would mean that among her, Liam, Noah, and Wendy, there is 1 spy. Thus Noah must be lying (making him a knave), since if he were truthful, both him and Grace would share roles, conflicting with her statement. Hence, Liam must also be a knave by Grace's truth. If David is a knight, this works since he would be right that 2 are telling the truth in a group containing 1 knight (David) and 2 knaves (Liam and Noah).\\n\\nSince no contradictions arise from this assumption, and checking back across statements validates this with Wendy being the spy, as she cannot just be a knight and thus falsely support everyone's claims. \\n\\n**Conclusion**: Grace and David are knights, while Noah and Liam are knaves, and Wendy must be the spy.

Thus, every other player must be either a knave or spy. This also means that Bob's statement, which claims Xavier is a knight, would be true. But if Bob is telling the truth, there are two knights (Bob and Xavier), which contradicts Xavier's statement. Therefore, if Xavier is a knight, Bob must be a knave.\\n\\n### Step 2: Analyze Yara's statement.\\nIf Bob is a knave (thus lying about Xavier), it means he says Xavier is a knight, which cannot be true. Thus, Xavier must be a knave if Bob is lying. However, this contradicts our assumption that Xavier is a knight. Hence, if we consider Yara's statement, at least one of her two statements is true: Only one of Bob and Xavier is truthful.

This could work. But if he is lying (knave), then there must be an odd number of knights (1 or 3).\\n\\n3. Next, consider Violet's statement: \\\"Sam and I are both knaves.\\\"\\n   - If Violet is telling the truth (knight), then Sam would also be a knave, which creates a contradiction since there can't be two knaves. Hence, Violet must be lying, making her a knave or, at most, a spy. So Violet is either a knave or the spy (since spies can lie).\\n\\n4. Noah states: \\\"Among Sam, Zane, and I, there are exactly two knaves.\\\"\\n   - If Noah is telling the truth (knight), then exactly two of the three must be knaves.

If Bob is a knight, then all mentioned would indeed have the same role, which conflicts with Hank being a knave (if Bob were a knight, then all of them must also either be knights or knaves, excluding Hank's existence).

However, we just deduced that Ivy is a knave and if Kate's statement is true, it would mean three players should be knaves, which could only happen if one of Sam, Peter, or Xavier were also a knave. \\n   - If Kate is lying, that means there are not three knaves, which we will clarify further after assessing others. \\n\\n4. **Analyzing Sam's Statement**: Sam says, \\\"Xavier, Ivy, and I do not all have the same role.\\\" Since Ivy is already established as a knave, if Sam is telling the truth, it implies Sam is neither a knave nor the same as Ivy, which means Sam could be a knight or a spy. \\n\\n5. **Analyzing Peter's Statement**: Peter states, \\\"Sam is telling the truth.\\\" If Peter is lying, then Sam must be lying too.

Next, let's look at Peter's statement: 'Among Wendy, Olivia, and Zane, the number of people who are lying is odd.' We have determined that Wendy is lying (knave), and Zane is lying (spy).

However, if Yara is the knave, her statement is false, meaning both would be knaves, which contradicts the assumption (only one can be a knave).

Thus, Grace must be lying, making her a knave.\\n   - From this, we conclude that Grace is a knave.\\n\\n3. **Analyzing Jack's Statement:** Jack states, \\\"Grace is telling the truth.” Since we have concluded that Grace is lying (and thus a knave), Jack's statement must be false. Therefore, Jack is not a knight and must be either a knave or a spy.\\n\\n4. **Analyzing Liam's Statement:** Liam states, \\\"Among Jack, Grace, Tina, and Wendy, the number of knaves is even.\\\" We have already established that Grace is a knave. We need to deduce the knave status of Jack, Tina, and Wendy. This information will help in validating Liam's statement.\\n\\n5. **Analyzing Tina's Statement:** Tina says, \\\"Among Grace, Liam, and Jack, the number of people who are telling the truth is odd.\\\" Since Grace is a knave, the number of truths told by Liam and Jack directly impacts Tina's statement.

If Uma were telling the truth, then there would be either 0 or 2 knaves among them. However, if Uma is a knight (truth-teller), the other three players would have to include only one knight among them, which creates complications, so we'll explore that assumption later. This assumption doesn't immediately prove anything.\\n\\n2. **Analyzing Liam's Statement:** Liam states that Frank, Uma, and Grace all have the same role. This can only be true if either they are all knights or all knaves. If either Uma or Frank is a knave, then Liam must also be a knave (since liars can't have the same role as truth-tellers).\\n\\n3. **Analyzing Frank’s Statement:** Frank claims that among Liam and Uma, exactly one person is telling the truth.

Let’s first analyze Rachel's statement: she claims that among her statement and the following two, exactly one is true. We treat each component:\\n   - Component (1): Sam, Eve, and Rachel do not all have the same role. \\n   - Component (2): Among all players, there are exactly four knaves.\\n\\n3. If Component (2) is true, it implies there are four knaves, meaning one player must not be a knave: thus, Bob would have to be the knight and this contradicts with the game manager's hint (because we know there is only one spy). Thus, Component (2) must be false.\\n\\n4. If Component (2) is false, there can't be four knaves. Therefore, we conclude that Component (1) must be true, meaning Sam and Eve cannot both be knaves (otherwise Rachel's claim of being different would be a lie).\\n\\n5. Next, we analyze Frank's claim: he states Bob is a spy. We already know only one spy exists (possibly Bob), which means Frank must be lying since if he were telling the truth, it would conflict with the roles we've started assigning.\\n\\n6. Sam’s statement: \\\"I am a knave\\\" creates a paradox if he were truly a knight (since a knight cannot truthfully claim to be a knave). Hence, Sam must be a knave. This means Sam's claim itself is a lie.\\n\\n7. Eve’s statement \\\"All are knaves\\\" has to be false because Rachel is not a knave, allowing for the possibility that she is indeed a knight as we are currently contemplating.\\n\\n8.

If Yara is a knight (truth-teller), then Grace and Xavier must indeed have different roles.

If Grace is a knight, this statement is true. If she is a knave, then all four (Charlie, Alice, Yara, and Grace) must have the same role.\\n\\n3. **Analyzing Xavier's statement:** Xavier says that Yara and Grace are either both telling the truth or both lying. This statement is indicative that they share the same truth status. If Xavier is a knight, both Yara and Grace must be telling the truth; if he is a knave, one is telling the truth while the other is lying.

Thus, if Alice is a knight, this is true and aligns with Xavier. If she is a knave, they do not share the same truth status.\\n\\n5. **Analyzing Charlie's statement:** Charlie states that among Grace, Yara, and Xavier, the number of people telling the truth is odd.

Then Grace and Xavier have different roles. Let's consider Grace as a knave (liar) because if Grace were a knight, then Xavier must be a knave (both cannot be knights). \\n  - If Grace is a knave, Charlie's statement about odd truthfulness should mean one of Yara or Xavier is a truth-teller.

So far, this scenario holds. \\n  - If Yara is knight and Grace is knave. Let’s check the validity of this. Charlie stating odd makes sense as Yara is knight, Grace is knave (truth) which makes odd count (1). \\n- Therefore, through contradiction, Grace being a knight leads to self-contradiction. So, Yara as knave doesn’t fit.\\n\\n- Now assume **Yara is a knave**. Then both Grace and Xavier would have the same role: if they are both knights, Yara's statement would have to be true, which is a contradiction, or both are knaves, which leads us to check validity if Yara, Grace are bad players. If Grace is a knave, Charlie’s statement can still lead to odd truth values of the three.\\n  - Considering Charlie tells the truth when Yara is knave sets a better structure since he indicates among Grace, Yara, Xavier being false leads us that Charlie can be knight and are checking odd count while not voiding their roles.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Yara as knave, Grace as knave, and Charlie establishes as knight. \\nThus Xavier must be the spy.

Let's analyze each player's statement to deduce their roles.\\n\\n**Step 1: Analyzing statements**\\n1. *Xavier's statement*: He claims that Kate, Liam, Quinn, and he all have the same role. If Xavier is telling the truth (i.e., a knight), then Kate, Liam, and Quinn must also be knights, which contradicts with the information that there is only one spy. Thus, if Xavier is truthful, it leads to multiple knights, which is impossible. Therefore, he must be lying, making him a knave.\\n2. *Quinn's statement*: He asserts that among Charlie, Xavier, and himself, the number of knights is even. If Xavier is a knave (as determined), then this statement can only be true if Quinn and Charlie are either both knaves or one of them is a spy, making the number of knights even. If Quinn is truthful, then the number of knights would be 0 or 2. This scenario becomes tricky if we assume he is a knight.\\n3. *Kate's statement*: She states that the number of spies is odd. However, given that there is exactly one spy, this implies that her statement is true if she's either a knight or false if she's a knave. Thus currently, we do not know her role directly.\\n4. *Liam's statement*: He states that he and Xavier have the same role. If Liam is truthful, he must also be a knave. But we already established Xavier as a knave, potentially leading Liam to be one too, making Liam's statement false thereby contradicting any knight assumption.\\n5. *Charlie's statement*: He claims that Kate and Xavier are either both telling the truth or both lying. Given our deduction that Xavier is a knave, this leads to Kate also having to be a knave to keep the statement true. Therefore, if Charlie is truthful (a knight), it implies both are lying.\\n\\n**Step 2: Clarifying the roles**\\nFrom the analysis: - Since Xavier is a knave, this clusters Charlie as likely the spy, unless Quinn proves to be true or false in a circular contradiction.\\n- If  Kate is a knave, it follows the odd count of spies (1) holds. Liam is therefore validated as a knight due to his correlation with Xavier being false.\\n- Now, Quinn’s assertion about the number of knights indicates an even coalition balancing with the knight hypothesis, allowing role circulation.\\n\\nUltimately processing through complications shows that both Quinn and Kate become knaves under this play, positing Charlie as the spy with only one truthful faction left (Xavier and Liam), concluding with finalized roles being established.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1099, "output": 640, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1739}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Therefore, Frank's statement is false, and he must be a knight, leading to a contradiction. Thus, Frank must be the knave.\\n   Hence: **Frank = knave.** \\n\\n3. Next, let's evaluate **Hank's statement**: Hank says that Frank, Rachel, Peter, Wendy, and he do not all have the same role. Since Frank is a knave, Hank's statement is true, making him a knight. \\n   Hence: **Hank = knight.** \\n\\n4. Now with **Wendy's statement**, she claims there is exactly one spy among her and Hank.

Moving on to **Rachel's statement**, where she claims that Wendy, Hank, and Peter have the same role, which cannot be valid since their roles differ. The statement has to be false, confirming Rachel must be the knave as Hank is a knight, so strategic thinking leads to Rachel being knight or knave.\\n\\n7.

If he’s lying (which would categorize him as a knave), there must be 0 or 2 knaves.\\n\\n2. **Xavier's Statement**: Xavier supports Jack’s claim, saying that Jack is telling the truth.

Therefore, if Jack is telling the truth, Xavier cannot be the only spy and must also be a knight.\\n   - Hence, Jack must be lying and thus is a knave. This leaves us with 0 or 2 knaves in Peter, Yara, and Xavier, and therefore, the total number of knaves is 2.\\n\\n3. **Logical Deductions**: Since Jack is confirmed to be a knave according to our analysis, that implies there are 2 knaves in the group (Yara and either Xavier or Peter). Let’s analyze Yara’s statement stating that Xavier and Jack are either both telling the truth or both lying. Since Jack is already confirmed as a knave, Yara must also be lying. Thus, she is also a knave. Now, we have 2 confirmed knaves (Jack and Yara).\\n\\n4. **Assessing Peter's Statement**: Peter states that Xavier, Yara, Kate, and he do not all have the same role. Since we already established that Yara is a knave, Peter must be a knight to ensure he is telling the truth.\\n   - Given that we also have one spy and we have three roles assigned already (Jack and Yara as knaves, and Peter as a knight), we are left with Xavier and Kate.\\n\\n5. **Evaluating Kate's Statement**: Kate’s claim is that the number of spies is even, which cannot be true with the presence of one spy (Xavier), as it would make her statement a lie. Hence, Kate is a knave.\\n   - This means Xavier must be the spy (since he doesn't contradict any of the established roles).\\n\\nThus, we conclude the roles are as follows: Jack is a knave, Xavier is a spy, Yara is a knave, Peter is a knight, and Kate is a knave.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1103, "output": 621, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1724}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

The hint states that among all players, there is exactly one spy. Therefore, we need to identify how many knights and knaves there are.\\n\\n2. Let's analyze Xavier's statement: he claims that either (1) there are exactly two knights or (2) Liam, Mia, and he do not all share the same role.\\n   - Let's consider **Case 1**, if (1) is true that there are exactly two knights. This would mean (2) is false, which implies that Liam, Mia, and Xavier are the same role. However, if they are all knaves, then both statements in Xavier's claim (1 and 2) cannot hold true, creating a contradiction. Thus, (1) must be false.\\n   - Therefore, (2) must be true: Liam, Mia, and Xavier do not have the same role.\\n\\n3. Analyzing the roles of Liam, Mia, and Xavier according to the finding from Xavier's statement: If (2) is true (they don't share the same role), one of them must at least be a knight. If we assume Xavier is a knight, then Liam and Mia must be knaves. This can be your assumption and **will lead to contradiction** later on.\\n\\n4. Move to Olivia's statement: Olivia states that Liam and Mia are both knaves. If Olivia tells the truth, then Liam is indeed a knave. Since knaves always lie, this matches with the deduction; if Liam is lying about being a knight, then he indeed is a knave. \\n   - So, if Olivia is truthful and indeed a knight, this verifies Liam as a knave is correct; thus potentially leaves Mia as either a knave or spy. \\n\\n5. Now consider Violet's statement: Violet states that Mia, Liam, Xavier, and she do not all have the same role. Given that Liam is confirmed as a knave and Olivia is deduced to be a knight, when we consider other configurations of roles for Mia and Xavier, Violet must also either be a knight or knave; but since we suspect that Olivia is a knight and Liam is a knave, either Violet must be lying or telling the truth based on their position. If Violet is a knight she would correctly state everyone has different roles.\\n\\n6. Mia's statement claims she and Violet have different roles - if Mia is a spy (assuming Olivia is a knight), this means her statement needs to lie or tell the truth. Assuming this makes sense, Violet could be a knave and says she and Mia, who are both identified with knaves could also be spys meaning Olivia's coalition holds.\\n\\n7. After consistent reasoning, as per exclusion:\\n   - Since Liam must be a knave, Mia could also be triangulated as the one spy since later evaluations lead back to true or false indicators. This indicates that Olivia and Xavier could be knights.\\n\\n8. Ultimately - there must be some contradictions: when evaluation of Knight vs knaves lead back to Olivia and Xavier assumes to be the knightly aspects, leaving Mia as a spy exposes that agreement from Xavier holds while both Olivia and Mia conflict creating second layers of rotation. \\n\\nIn conclusion, once re-evaluating the statements made by players combined with the hint provided; we conclude: \\n- Xavier is the knight, confirmed through consistent contradiction of both characters in the triangular chain leads back through multiple logical evaluations.\\n- Liam and Violet against the conclusion both remain knaves absolutely therefore leaving Mia as the only spy isolated by description. \\n\"}", "usage": {"input": 1122, "output": 799, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1921}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Thus, Yara cannot be a knight.\\nNext, if Yara is a knave, then both statements end up as 'false’, which means:\\n- (1) Frank and Bob have the same role,  \\n- (2) There are either 0 or more than 1 spy among them, which contradicts the game manager's hint.\\nThis leads us to suspect that Yara must be the spy: meaning one of the statements is true and the other false.\\n\\n**Step 2: Checking the validity of sub-statements when Yara is the spy:**  \\n- If (1) is true, then Frank and Bob are different. If true, (2) must be false, which means at least 2 spies are among them, which contradicts our hint. So (1) is wrong, hence (2) must be true: one of them is the spy (Yara) and means Frank and Bob must be the same.\\n\\n**Step 3: Analyze Bob's statement**  \\nBob claims there are exactly two knaves among Alice, Ivy, and Frank. As we deduce Yara is the spy, whoever is telling truth among Alice, Ivy, and Frank narrows down possible roles of Bob, Ivy, and Frank. If Bob is true, that would make either Alice or Ivy a knave.\\n\\n**Step 4: Checking Ivy’s statement**  \\nIvy states Bob tells the truth. If Ivy is truthful, it implies Bob's statement regarding the knaves has to be accurate. Yet, if Bob's statement is correct about 'exactly two', since we already settled that Yara is a spy, it necessitates one of Alice or Frank must be a knave. Thus, they can't both be knaves contradicting Bob's statement.\\nConsequently, if Bob is telling the truth, it must be that Ivy is indeed a knave. \\n\\n**Step 5: Analyze Frank's statement**  \\nFrank claims that Bob, Yara, Ivy, and Alice all share the same role implying that all are either knights or knaves. If Bob is truthful (knight) and Ivy a knave and Yara a spy already contradicts, so Frank must necessarily be either knave or spy but with the previous possibility Yara is, we conclude Frank must be lying (knave).\\n\\n**Step 6: Summarize conclusions**  \\nSo far, we conclude:  \\n- Yara is the spy (1 statement true)  \\n- Bob must be the knight (truthful about ivy’s and Alice situation; leading to 2 knaves outside Alice)\\n- Ivy must be knave  \\n- Frank is then concluded as knave as well due only possibility left.\\n- Alice must be knight, confirming more knights exist despite reporting an even number; showing her role can’t conflict with coming to one knave from Bob’s side confirming previous counts claiming to have full clarity.\\n\\n**Therefore:** Players are resolved into:\\nBob: Knight,  Ivy: Knave, Yara: Spy, Frank: Knave, Alice: Knight.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1126, "output": 825, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1951}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Since there is exactly one spy, Eve could either be truthful (if she is a knight) or deceptive (if she is lying). If we assume she is a knight, then it supports her statement. \\n\\n2. **Quinn** states that Eve, Hank, and Kate do not all have the same role. This indicates varying roles among them. If Quinn is telling the truth, at least one of Eve or Hank must have a different role than Kate. If Quinn is lying, that would mean Eve, Hank, and Kate do share the same role. \\n\\n3. **Kate** says there is exactly one spy among Uma, Eve, Hank, and herself. Since we know there is one spy total, this implication could align with our deduction if Kate is truthful; but if she is lying, that directly alters the count. \\n\\n4. **Hank** claims there is exactly one knight among Kate, Eve, and himself.

This configuration fits that there is indeed an odd number of knights (2).

Now let's analyze the statements made by the players.\\n\\n1. **Tina's statement:** 'Among David and Olivia, there is exactly one spy.' Since there is only one spy overall, we need to check if this could be true or false.\\n   - If Tina is a knight (truth-teller), then either David or Olivia must be the spy. However, that will contradict the hint unless one of them is indeed the spy. Since there can only be one spy, we will evaluate whether David or Olivia can be the spy later.\\n   - If Tina is a knave, her statement is false indicating both David and Olivia are either knights or knaves. This leads to complications given the roles of others. Therefore, we tentatively assume Tina could be a knight.\\n\\n2. **Xavier's statement:** 'Among David, Olivia, Tina, and I, the number of spies is odd.' If Xavier is telling the truth, he can only be the spy based on the hint. This means David, Olivia, and Tina must all be knights. This contradicts earlier deductions. Therefore, Xavier must be lying (as a knave).\\n\\n3. **Eve's statement:** 'I am a knave.' If Eve tells the truth about being a knave, it leads to a contradiction because knaves cannot tell the truth. Hence, Eve must be lying, giving her the role of a knave.\\n\\n4. **Olivia's statement:** She dissects two statements for truth. We need to evaluate both:\\n   - Statement (1): 'Eve, David, and I do not all have the same role.' This would be true if either Eve (a knave) or David (yet to be evaluated) differs from Olivia. Therefore, this statement suggests Olivia must be a knight if it's true.\\n   - Statement (2): 'Xavier, Eve, Tina, and I all have the same role.' This would only hold if all are either knights or all are knaves. Since Eve is a knave, one or more of the others must differ. If (1) is true, (2) must be false and should validate their roles. \\n\\n5. **David's statement:** 'Eve, Tina, Xavier, and I all have the same role.'

This means the roles of the players must be configured accordingly, knowing that knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie.\\n\\n2. **Evaluate Jack's statement**: Jack claims that the number of knaves is odd. If Jack is a knight (telling the truth), then there must be an odd number of knaves. If he is a knave (lying), there would be an even number of knaves.\\n\\n3. **Analyze Eve’s statement**: Eve states that Zane, Quinn, and Jack all have the same role. If Eve tells the truth and they are all knights, then Jack's statement must also align with that, meaningthere are 0 knaves, which contradicts Jack's claim. If Eve is lying, Zane, Quinn, and Jack must have different roles.\\n\\n4. **Look at Kate's statement**: Kate claims that Jack and Eve are either both telling the truth or both lying. If they are both telling the truth, then Jack must be a knight. If they are both lying, then Jack must be a knave. We will take this into consideration.\\n\\n5. **Examine Quinn's statement**: Quinn asserts that Eve and Kate are either both telling the truth or both lying. If Quinn is truthful, then this also interacts with Kate's analysis. However, if Quinn is lying, it will lead to mixed states between Eve and Kate.\\n\\n6. **Inspect Zane's statement**: Zane states that among Jack, Eve, and Quinn, the number of knights is odd. If Zane is a knight, then one or three among Jack, Eve, and Quinn must be knights. If Zane is telling the truth and Jack were a knight, we cannot have Eve be a knight as well since their roles would need to consistently align with an odd count. If Zane is lying, then zero or two among Jack, Eve, and Quinn are knights.\\n\\nNow, let's test the assumption that Jack is indeed a knight:\\n- If Jack is a knight (truthful), then there must be an odd number of knaves (1 or 3).\\n- If Jack's statement is true (1 knave), then from Eve (who claims Jack, Quinn, and herself are the same) must be a knave (i.e. lying) – because they can't all be the same, we have to assume Eve is lying.\\n- If Eve is a knave, then Jack and Quinn can’t both be knights, which means Jack’s statement holds true, and Quinn would therefore indeed be a knave as well.\\n\\n7. **Validate with Zane's statement**: Assume Zane is the spy. Under these configurations, Jack is knight, Eve and Quinn are knaves. This still affords one knight (Jack), and precisely one spy (Zane).\\n\\n8. **Examine Kate**: Given that both Jack and Eve must now be assumed under Jack's truthfulness (with Eve's lying), Kate must therefore also be a knave (held true by Eve's contradiction assertion). \\n\\nThus, in conclusion:\\n- Jack: knight (truth-teller about knaves being odd),\\n- Eve: knave (lies about roles being the same),\\n- Quinn: knave (since Jack is truthful and mix roles align under Eve’s falsehood).\\n- Zane: spy (can tell the truth or lie, fits the unique count),\\n- Kate: knave (consistently lying about both being under truth).\\n\\nHence, the final roles are Jack as knight, Eve, Quinn, and Kate as knaves, and Zane as the only spy.

We know there is one spy; thus, the maximum number of knaves can be three, and the minimum can be zero.\\n   - If there are zero knaves, Grace is lying. If there are two knaves, Grace's statement is true.\\n   - If there is only one knave, her statement would be false.\\n\\n4. **Considering Mia's Statement:** Mia claims that among Grace, Violet, and herself, there are two knaves.

Start by considering the hint from the game manager that there is exactly one spy among all players.\\\\n\\\\n2. First, examine Olivia's statement: 'Among all players, there are exactly four knaves.' Since we know there is only one spy, if Olivia were telling the truth, there would have to be four knaves, making a total of five players, which is not possible as there are only six players and only one spy. Thus, Olivia must be lying, confirming that she is a knave.\\\\n\\\\n3. Since Olivia is a knave, we look at Bob's statement: 'Olivia, Jack, and Sam are all knaves.' Since Olivia is indeed a knave, Bob's statement could only be true if both Jack and Sam are also knaves. If Bob was telling the truth, that would invalidate the existence of a spy since we would have four knaves plus the spy making the total roles inconsistent with the hint. Thus, Bob cannot be telling the truth, meaning he also must be lying (confirming he cannot be a knight). Therefore, Bob is the spy.\\\\n\\\\n4. Now we know Bob is the spy and Olivia is a knave. Next, let's analyze Sam's statement: 'Among Bob, Jack, and I, the number of knights is even.' Given that Bob is the spy, we have two cases regarding Jack: if Jack were a knight, then Sam's statement would mean there is one knight (odd), contradicting Sam's claim. Thus, Jack must also be a knight since only one knight in the trio wouldn't work. Therefore, Sam must be lying and is a knave.\\\\n\\\\n5. With Olivia and Sam confirmed as knaves, we have only one player left (Eve). Eve states: 'Jack and Sam have different roles.'

If she is telling the truth (therefore a knight), then her statement would contradict her being a knight because knights cannot be knaves; thus, she has to be lying, making her a knave.\\n   - If Olivia is a knave, she cannot be telling the truth about herself, therefore her statement that she is a knave is indeed false. Hence, she is the knave. \\n   - This allows us to confirm that Olivia is a knave.\\n\\n4. **Analyzing Noah's statement**: Noah says that among Zane, Eve, and himself, the number of spies is odd.

If Noah is lying (as deduced if Grace is a knight), then Grace must be a knight and Noah must be a knave, consistent with this premise.\\n\\n3. Moving on to Tina’s statement: 'Among Grace, Noah, Frank, and I, there is exactly one knight.' If Tina says there is one knight and she's telling the truth, then either Grace or Zane must be the knight. However, if Grace is a knight, that means Tina's statement can work, while Noah is a liar and assuming Frank is knight entails contradictions.\\n\\n4. Evaluating Frank's statement: 'Among Noah, Tina, and Grace, the number of people telling the truth is even.' This is informative because if Grace is telling the truth (she's a knight), and she and Tina's contradictory positions suggest Frank's statement would imply only two are lying (Noah and Frank). Thus, Frank’s statement is likely false, making him a knave.\\n\\n5. Now let’s look at Zane’s statement: 'Frank, Grace, and Tina do not all have the same role.' Assuming he's telling the truth (if Grace is knight, Zane must also be knight), leading us to conclude Frank is a knave, qualifying Zane as another knight.\\n\\n6. This gives a composition; Grace the knight, Noah the knave, Tina the spy, and Frank the knave. This matches all statements given.\\n\\nSo we deduced that Grace is a knight, Noah is a knave, Tina is the spy, and Frank is a knave while Zane too holds the knight role.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1105, "output": 522, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1627}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Thus, Kate and Wendy must both be knaves or both are truthfully indicating closeness to Zane's role, which leads us to contradictions.\\n\\n4. **Assuming Zane is the Knight:** If Zane is indeed a knight, that would mean an odd number of knaves exists (at least 1, 3, etc.), and so far Bob's statement must be false, confirming his role as a knave.\\n\\n5. **Resolving Between Alice, Kate, and Wendy:**\\n   - If Bob is a knave, Alice’s statement should hold some value. If Alice states Wendy and I have the same role, they could either both be knaves or both be spies. If Alice is the spy (as per the hint assumption), then she tells truthfully. But we still have the odd constraint of knaves depending on Kate’s role, balancing odd/even counts.\\n   - Suppose Kate must be aligned with Wendy's stance, if both roles match, Kate must be lying.\\n   - It seems safest if Alice takes the spy honor based on her middle positioning between knaves—meaning she possibly holds higher intrigue and alignment.\\n\\n6. **Solving for Remaining Players:** From here, consider that with only one spy, if Alice is a spy then Wendy contradicts herself separably if linked with Kate.

The game manager states that there is exactly one spy among all players. This helps us narrow down the roles.  \\n2. Let's first analyze Mia's statement: 'Among Quinn, Charlie, and Rachel, there are exactly two knaves.' If Mia is telling the truth (i.e., she is a knight), then exactly two of Quinn, Charlie, and Rachel are knaves. If Mia is lying (i.e., she is a knave), then either one or all three of them are knaves.  \\n3. Next, we examine Charlie's statement: 'Mia is telling the truth.' If Charlie is telling the truth, then Mia is a knight. If he is lying, Mia is a knave.  \\n4. Assuming Mia is a knight, then Charlie's statement must also be true; therefore, he would then be a knight as well, leading to a contradiction because there cannot be two knaves among Quinn, Charlie, and Rachel (which would imply Charlie must be a knight).  \\n5. Therefore, Mia cannot be a knight, which implies she must be lying and hence a knave. This leads to the conclusion that less than two of Quinn, Charlie, and Rachel are knaves (either one or none).  \\n6. Since Mia is a knave, Charlie’s statement 'Mia is telling the truth' must be false, indicating that Charlie is also a knave. Hence, now we have: Mia (knave) and Charlie (knave).  \\n7. Now we analyze Rachel's statement: 'Charlie, Jack, and Mia do not all have the same role.' Since both Mia and Charlie are knaves, there is at least one player among them (Jack) that is a knight. This implies that Rachel’s statement must be true as Jack must be the knight (since two players are confirmed to be knaves).  \\n8. Rachel’s statement therefore makes Rachel herself not a knight, leaving Quinn and Jack for evaluation.  \\n9. Let's analyze Quinn's statement: 'Among Rachel, Jack, Mia, and I, the number of knaves is even.'

If Eve is a knave (liar), then there are an odd number of knaves (1 or 3) among these players.\\n\\n2. **Bob's Statement**: \\\"Eve is telling the truth.\\\" If Bob is telling the truth (therefore a knight or a spy), it confirms that Eve is also telling the truth. If Bob lies (making him a knave), then Eve must be lying.\\n\\n3. **Wendy's Statement**: \\\"Eve and Grace are either both telling the truth or both lying.\\\" This statement indicates that their roles are aligned. If Wendy tells the truth, then both Eve and Grace have the same role (either knight or knave). If Wendy is lying, one of them must be lying and the other telling the truth.\\n\\n4. **Hank's Statement**: \\\"Wendy, Bob, and I all have the same role.\\\" If Hank is telling the truth, it means Wendy, Bob, and Hank are either all knights or all knaves. If Hank is lying, at least one of them must differ in role.\\n\\n5. **Grace's Statement**: \\\"Wendy, Bob, and Eve do not all have the same role.\\\" If Grace is telling the truth, then one player among Wendy, Bob, and Eve must be a different role compared to the others. If she's lying, it means they are either all the same or all different.\\n\\n### Step 1: Assume Bob is the Spy\\nIf we assume Bob is the spy, his statement about Eve telling the truth could be either true or false. Let's assume for now that Eve is a knight. Thus, there are 2 knaves among Hank, Grace, Wendy, and Bob. \\n- This means one possibility is Hank and Grace are knaves, making Wendy either a knight or a knave. \\n\\nNow evaluating Grace's statement: If Wendy, Bob, and Eve are not all the same role, and assuming Eve is a knight, then Wendy must be a knave (since if she were a knight, Bob would also need to be a knight, contradicting the knaves count)\\n- If Grace is a knave, her statement about differences must be false, meaning Wendy, Bob and Eve are the same. Wendy being a knave confirms she is lying about Eve role.\\n\\n### Contradictions on the Spy and Knight Role Assume\\nIf Eve is a knave as per conflicts with Wendy's roles, Bob's role aligns with Eve making their statements both untrue since he is the spy. This only allows for a single knave set, confirming 2 knaves among Bob, Wendy, and Hank contradicts the initial statement of having 2 knaves. \\n\\n### Conclusion With Repeated Evaluations\\nThrough our deductions:\\n- Eve must be a knight, confirming the logistics through strengths of contradiction calling for knaves with Hank, Grace, and Wendy. Winds blowing Bob's statements took him as the only spy, aligning all within their contradictions to find one out.\\n- Finally, confirming the unique find of roles all conclude towards the strongest and truthful player required from the statements made leads us to compile Hank and Grace as knaves effectively.\\nTherefore, the roles deduced are that Eve is a knight, Grace, and Wendy as knaves; Bob lies in conversation as the spy.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1101, "output": 844, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1945}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Therefore, Tina is knights, Wendy and Frank as knaves, while Eve's role asserts her as a spy witnessing the untruthful nature around her.\\n\\nIn summary, Tina is identified as a knight, Wendy and Frank as knaves, Eve is the spy, and Hank must also be knight for the exceptional sense of configuration.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1102, "output": 704, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1806}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

In this case, Uma must be a knave (since Sam and Grace are knights).\\n  - Alice would then have to be a knave (since if she were a knight there would be two knights among Sam, Grace, and Uma, contradicting one knight in that selection).

Since Uma is truthful, she states Sam is lying confirming he is a knave.\\n  - Grace must also be a knave (as per Uma's truthfulness, implying Sam's lying confirms Grace's dependency on Sam's lying).

For Alice's statement to be true, either statement (1) must be false and statement (2) true, or statement (1) must be true and statement (2) false.\\n- Since Grace is a knave, statement (1) cannot be true because it claims all (Alice, David, Grace, Uma) share the same role.

So David cannot be a knight if Jack is a knave or spy.  \\n\\n3. Therefore, David can be either a knave or a spy himself.

This is compatible when there are no more than one knight aside from Mia. If Mia is lying (knave), then the number must be even (0 or 2 knights).  \\n\\n6. Next, analyze Alice's statement: \\\"Among Zane, Mia, and I, there are exactly two knaves.\\\" If Alice is telling the truth, then either Zane is a knight, Mia is a knave, and Alice is a knave or vice versa.

Consequently, if Kate is telling the truth (knight), one or three of them (Yara, Bob, Zane) is lying; if she is lying (knave), it means an even number (0 or 2) are lying.\\n\\n5. **Analyzing Tina's statement**: Tina indicates that exactly one of two statements is true: (1) Zane is a knight, (2) Yara, Zane, and she all have the same role. If Tina is telling the truth (knight), that means Zane is indeed a knight, making statement (2) false; if lying (knave), then both statements cannot coexist truthfully.\\n\\n**We proceed with a deduction**:\\n- The game manager's hint implicates there is exactly one spy. This ensures one of the players must fulfill this role amongst Bob, Zane, Yara, and Kate.\\n\\n- Assume Zane is the knight. This contradicts Yara’s statement to make Kate and Tina of the same role, since for Zane being knight, both must be knights, indicating Zane’s false.\\n  - Thus Zane must be the knave.\\n\\n- Since Zane is a knave, that means Bob must then also be truthful in his statement, meaning Bob is knight, and the statement made by Bob must be validated.\\n\\n- Since Bob is a knight, at least one of Tina or Zane is different from him. Knowing Zane is a knave, it leaves Tina as potentially knave or knight.\\n\\n- If we apply these to Yara: she must be lying, leaving Kate with dubious credibility. Hence, since Yara is lying, Kate is concluded as the spy; Kate cannot hence align with Bob nor can she hence be a knight, placing her as spy alongside the dynamics of this condition English.\\n\\n- Given Tina must therefore also fall as knight while Zane remains knave, finally, Yara substantiates as a knave.\\n\\nThis validation thus resolves to: Bob (knight), Zane (knave), Yara (knave), Kate (spy), and Tina (knight).

If Bob is a knight (truth-teller), then this statement is true, and they all must be knights. But since we know there's one spy, at least one of them must be lying which contradicts Bob being a knight. Therefore, Bob cannot be a knight.\\n\\n2. **Assume Bob is lying**: If Bob is a knave (liar), then his statement about everyone having the same role is false.

If Bob is lying and Wendy is telling the truth, it contradicts the assumption Bob is a knave. Therefore, Wendy must also be lying, which makes her a knave.\\n\\n4. **Now analyze Ivy's statement**: Ivy states that among Jack, Bob, Wendy, and herself, the number of knights is even. Since we have established that Bob and Wendy are knaves, this means Ivy is claiming there are 0 knights among them. If Ivy is telling the truth about there being an even number of knights (which could be 0), she can be true either as a knight or as a spy. However, if she were a knight, her statement would imply she is a knight, contradicting her claim of 0 knights (because she would be a knight).

Alice's statement: \\\"Kate and Charlie are either both telling the truth or both lying.\\\"\\n   - If Alice tells the truth, Charlie and Kate have the same role (either both knights or both knaves).\\n   - If Alice is lying, then one is telling the truth and the other is lying.\\n\\n4.

Frank claims that both he and Yara are knights.\\n\\n3. **Consider Frank's Claim**: If Frank is telling the truth, then both he and Yara are knights. This means Yara must also be telling the truth, which leads to further conclusions about everyone else._However, if Frank is lying, then at least one of them is not a knight. \\n\\n4. **Assuming Frank is a Knight**: Let’s investigate Frank’s statement assuming he is telling the truth. If he is a knight, Yara must be a knight too. This leads directly to a contradiction when considering Sam's statement.\\n\\n5. **Proceed with Sam's Statement**: Sam says that among Tina, Yara, Quinn, and Frank, an odd number of them are telling the truth. Since Quinn is already established as a knave (always lies), if Sam is right, we need to analyze further.\\n\\n6. **Check if Sam is a Knight**: If Sam is a knight (telling the truth), this means we have an even odd count with just Frank lying (Taub has six cases).

Examine Grace's statement: \\\"Quinn and Noah are both knights.\\\" If Grace is telling the truth, then Quinn and Noah are indeed knights, which is inconsistent with the hint that there is only one spy—because we can conclude at least one of them must be lying. Therefore, Grace is lying, implying she is a knave.\\n\\n3. Since Grace is a knave, Quinn and Noah cannot both be knights. \\n   - We will revisit Quinn's statement shortly but let's see Tina's statement for context. \\n\\n4. Now analyze Tina's statement: \\\"Rachel, Grace, and I are all knaves.\\\" We know Grace is a knave, so if Tina is telling the truth, then Rachel must also be a knave. But if Rachel is a knave, then all individuals (Noah, Grace, Tina, and Rachel) cannot share the same role, which they would if Tina is also telling the truth. Thus, Tina's statement itself contradicts. Therefore, Tina must be lying and is not a knave, so she could potentially be a knight or a spy. Ideally, based on the game manager's hint, she will turn out to be a spy.\\n\\n5. Let's analyze Rachel's statement: \\\"Noah, Tina, Grace, and I all have the same role.\\\" Since Grace is a knave, this statement cannot be true. Thus, Rachel must also be lying and therefore is a knave.\\n\\n6. Now we return to Quinn's statement: \\\"Among Tina and I, there is exactly one spy.\\\" We assume Quinn is a knight, then Tina must be the spy; this is consistent with our examination of her statement. Hence, this is valid because Noah and Rachel are both knaves. But since Rachel has given false statements about her and the group roles, she is a knave as well.\\n\\n7.

If Zane is a knight, then his statement is true and Violet is indeed a knight. \\n   - If Zane is a knave, then Violet is not a knight. Let’s keep this in mind as we evaluate other statements.\\n\\n3. Next, evaluate Hank's statement: 'Sam, Mia, Zane, and I all have the same role.' If Hank is telling the truth, then all four share the same role. If that were the case, there could only be one spy among them. If Hank were a knight, then they must all be knights, which contradicts the game manager's hint. Thus, Hank must be lying, making him a knave.\\n   - Since Hank is a knave, his assertion is false, meaning that Sam, Mia, Zane, and Hank do not all share the same role.\\n\\n4. Examine Sam's statement which says that among two statements, exactly one is true:\\n   (1) 'Violet, Mia, and I all have the same role.' \\n   (2) 'Among all players, there is exactly one spy.' \\n   - We know the second statement is true. Therefore, the first must be false, implying that at least one among Violet, Mia, and Sam does not share the same role. Since Sam thus cannot be a knight, he can only be the spy or a knave. Since we know only one spy exists, we will consider him as the spy for now.\\n\\n5. Evaluate Violet's statement: 'Among Zane, Sam, and Hank, the number of people who are telling the truth is odd.' Assuming Sam is the spy and may or may not be telling the truth, this leaves Zane (who we suspect to be a knave) and Hank (also a knave) involved in this. Since Zane and Hank are both knaves, they lie, so Zane cannot help establish the truth value of Violet's statement, making Sam's truth value indeterminate in conjunction with Violet's.\\n   - This means Violet must be truthful if she states the number of truth-tellers is odd, correctly identifying Sam as the only potential truth-teller (due to his being the spy).\\n\\n6.

Since Wendy is a knave, Rachel's statement 'Wendy, Yara, and Peter are all telling the truth' must be false because one of them (Wendy) is lying.

If her statement is true, that aligns with the hint, meaning she could potentially be a knight. If she’s lying, that means the number of spies is 0 or more than 1, which contradicts the hint given by the manager. Hence, Kate must be telling the truth, which means she is indeed a knight.\\n\\n2. **Since Kate is a knight**, under her assertion, we conclude there is exactly one spy. This further allows us to use her statement as a basis for our deductions about the other players.\\n\\n3. **Now, let's analyze Noah's statement**: Noah states that Kate, Peter, and he do not all have the same role. Since we figured Kate is a knight, Noah must be either a knave or a spy, which aligns with his statement if he is a knave because it would mean he is lying, indicating they do not all have the same role (which they do not). So, we can conjecture Noah is a knave.\\n\\n4. **Next is Wendy's statement**: Wendy indicates that Frank, Kate, Peter, and herself do not all have the same role. Since we already identified Kate as a knight, if Wendy is telling the truth, then neither Frank nor Peter can both be knights. This creates a question about Frank and Peter's role.\\n \\n5. **Peter's statement**: Peter’s claim states that among two statements, only one is true. He could either be lying or telling the truth, which creates a logical puzzle among Noah. Since we suspect Noah is a knave, then if Peter is telling the truth, it means that the first statement ('Noah and I have the same role') is false (meaning Noah is indeed a knave, and Peter is not). \\n\\n6. However, let's examine Frank's statement: He asserts that Kate, Noah, and Peter are either all telling truth or all lying. If Kate is a knight and telling the truth, then Frank must be lying, indicating he cannot be a knight.\\n\\n7. This aligned contradiction leads us to deduce that Peter must be the spy, as he can tell the truth or lie.

This could apply similarly to Quinn's statement, stating that Jack's claim also leads to contradictions when paired with Xavier's potential innocence.\\n\\n5. Now looking at Yara's statement about Jack, Xavier, and Quinn, where she states they are either all telling the truth or all lying. This becomes significant. If we assume Jack is a knave, that would mean Yara must also be guilty of lying or telling the truth. If all three (Jack, Xavier, Quinn) are lying, then they must include Jack, otherwise Yara's claim is a paradox. Thus, she must be a knight if Jack is guilty.\\n\\n6. Analyzing Olivia's statement that Yara and Jack have the same role puts an emphasis on their correlation. If Jack is a knave, then Yara must be a knight. As previously established, Jack is a liar, making Jack a knave and Yara a knight accurate. Thus if Olivia is also lying in this case she is more likely to be a knave as well.\\n\\n7. Hence from observing the roles selectively: Quinn is a knight (assuming her claim balances with Yara being a knight), Jack is a knave (conforming to Quinn’s statement about truth vs lies), Xavier must be the spy (for leaving a certain truth camp), and Olivia rounds out to be a knave (being involved in a conflicting statement about Yara).\\n\\nThus the roles are gathered:\\n- Quinn = knight\\n- Xavier = spy\\n- Jack = knave\\n- Yara = knight\\n- Olivia = knave.\"}", "usage": {"input": 1111, "output": 591, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1702}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Start with Eve's statement: \\\"Among Ivy, Olivia, and I, there are exactly two knaves.\\\" \\n   - This means at least two of them (Eve, Olivia, Ivy) are known knaves if Eve is telling the truth. If Eve is lying, then the number of knaves among them could be either one or none.\\n\\n2. Let's consider Charlie's statement: \\\"Among the following two statements, exactly one is true: \\n   (1). Olivia, Eve, Ivy, and I all have the same role. \\n   (2). Among Eve, Alice, and I, there is exactly one spy.\\\"\\n   - If (1) is true, then Olivia, Eve, Ivy, and Charlie have the same role.

Hence, (1) cannot be true.\\n   - Therefore, (2) must be true which means there is exactly one spy among Eve, Alice, and Charlie. Since we know Charlie claims that one of them is a spy, this places Charlie as the spy or leads to contradictions if he were a knave, revealing his role must be the spy.\\n\\n3. Look at Olivia's statement: \\\"Ivy and I have the same role.\\\"\\n   - If Olivia is lying (which we will assume as we come to find her to be a knave), then Ivy must have a different role compared to her. \\n   - If Olivia is a knave, Ivy must then be a knight.\\n\\n4.

If Alice is telling the truth, then it means that there are three knaves among Peter, Yara, Wendy, and Alice. Hence, one of these players must be the knight, making Alice a knight. This implies:\\n   - Among Peter, Yara, and Wendy, there must be three knaves, contradicting the existence of only one spy.\\n   - Therefore, Alice must be lying about the count of knaves, which implies she is a knave. Thus, we assume Alice is a knave.\\n\\n2. **Analysis of Peter's Statement:** Peter states that Hank, Wendy, and himself do not all have the same role. If Peter is a knight (truth-teller), then not all three share the same role. However, if Peter is a knave, at least one of Hank or Wendy must differ from Peter.\\n   - Suppose Peter is a knight: This means Hank and Wendy cannot all be of the same role.

If Hank tells the truth, then there is indeed an odd number of knaves.\\n   - If true, this would provide support for the claim that at least 3 knaves exist among Alice, Peter, Wendy, and Yara, since they cannot all be knights. If Hank is a liar (which must be checked), this can change dynamics if we explore odd/even roles.\\n\\n4. **Analysis of Wendy's Statement:** Wendy states that among Alice, Hank, and Peter, the number of liars is odd. If Wendy is telling the truth, then at least one of them must be lying, which is consistent with our existing possibilities.\\n   - If Alice (assumed liars), then Wendy must also be a knave.\\n\\n5. **Analysis of Yara's Statement:** Yara claims that Peter and Hank have the same role.

If he were lying (he's a knave), then there would be fewer than three knaves.\\n\\n2. **Assume Jack is a knight (truthful):** This means Quinn, Olivia, and Charlie must be knaves, leading to this distribution:\\n   - Jack: Knight\\n   - Olivia: Knave\\n   - Quinn: Knave\\n   - Charlie: Knave\\n   - Xavier: Spy (as there's exactly one spy).\\n   - This holds with Jack's statement – there are indeed three knaves.\\n\\n3. **Check Olivia's statement:** If Jack is a knight, then Olivia’s statement that Charlie, Jack, and Xavier all have the same role must be false (since she can't be telling the truth as a knave). Therefore, Charlie and Jack cannot share the same role, which works since Jack is a knight and Olivia is a knave.\\n\\n4. **Check Quinn's statement:** Since Jack is truthful, Quinn must also be a knave.

Hence, Mia is the knave. 3. Now, we know Mia is a knave. Looking at Zane's statement: One of Zane's statements must be false because he claims, 'Among the following two statements, exactly one is true.' If Zane is a knight, both statements would be true, which is a contradiction, confirming Zane is not a knight. 4. This leads us to conclude that Zane must be a knave. 5. Since Zane is confirmed as a knave, the implication of his statements allows us to conclude that both of his claims about knavery must be false: they are both not knaves. So, Mia is indeed the only knave along with Zane. 6. Now we look at Frank's statement: 'Among all players, there is exactly one knight.' If Frank is telling the truth about knights, then he must be telling the truth himself. Therefore, Frank is potentially knight. 7.
