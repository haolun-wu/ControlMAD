If exactly one of these statements is true:\\n   - If **(1) is true**, it means Hank is a knight, then (2) is also true because both would be knights, which is a contradiction. Hence, **(1) must be false** (Hank is not a knight), making (2) true. Therefore, **Tina is a knight** and Hank must be a knave since they cannot have the same role.\\n   - So, we now know Hank is a knave.\\n\\n2. **Sam's statement:** It says either: (1) all three (Violet, Tina, and Sam) have the same role; or (2) the number of knaves is odd. Since we have established that Tina is a knight, **(1) must be false**. Then, **(2) must be true**, indicating the number of knaves is indeed odd.

Since we have Tina as a knight and Hank as a knave, Violet cannot be telling the truth, therefore **Violet is also a knight**.\\n   - With **Hank as the knave and Tina and Violet both as knights,** their roles cannot match Wendy's stating the same role.

Since there's only one spy total, Wendy must be telling the truth, which means that there cannot be an even number of spies among them, which causes a contradiction since there must be two spies in that group to satisfy Wendy's statement. Hence, Wendy cannot be lying. Therefore, Wendy must be a knight. \\n\\n3. Since Wendy is a knight, her statement is true. We know that Jack must be the only spy because of the conflict. This means that there are zero spies among Olivia, Tina, and Wendy; therefore, it implies that the last spy must be Jack. \\n   - Hence, Jack is the only remaining spy in this context, and Wendy's number of spies among her, Olivia, Tina, and Jack must be two people in that group being not the same roles which suggests the other two being knaves while Jack is a spy. This must also support Wendy's statement bringing the count remaining into harmony. \\n\\n4. We can now turn to Olivia's statement.

Since we have concluded that Olivia must be a knave and Jack is established as a spy, it leads us to conclude that Tina is also a knave.\\n\\n6.

Now to validate the statement from Tina: \\\"Among Grace, Liam, and Jack, the number of people telling the truth is odd.\\\" Given Grace is a knave, and Liam is telling the truth (knight), and if Jack is a spy, he can be deceiving, so this statement is true. Hence, Tina is also a knave.\\n6. Lastly, Wendy states, \\\"Among Liam, Jack, Tina, and Grace, exactly two people are telling the truth.\\\" If Liam is a knight (truth teller) and Jack the spy (who may take either role), it leads us to determine Wendy must be a knave as well, yielding three knaves and not fulfilling her statement.\\n7.

This means that the roles span over knights and knaves predominantly, with only one spy present.\\n   \\n2. **Uma's statement:** She claims that among the four (Grace, Hank, Frank, and herself), the number of knaves is even. Therefore, this could imply either 0 or 2 knaves among them.\\n\\n3. **Liam's statement:** He states that Frank, Uma, and Grace all have the same role. This would mean they are either all knights or all knaves. Since we have at least one knave (as per Uma's statement conditions), it cannot be that they are all knights.\\n\\n4. **Frank's statement:** He says that among Liam and Uma, exactly one person is telling the truth. For Liam to be telling the truth, Uma must be lying, consistent with Uma being a knave. \\n\\n5. **Grace's statement:** She claims Hank is a knave. If Grace is a knight, then it must be true that Hank is indeed a knave.\\n\\n6. **Hank's statement:** He posits that among Uma, Grace, and himself, the number of knights is odd. If Hank is a knave, this statement would be false, meaning there must be an even number of knights among them, otherwise it would contradict the rules.\\n\\nLet's analyze these statements by assuming certain roles:\\n\\n**Case Analysis:**  \\n- **Assume Uma is a knave (as suspected from structure).** When Uma is a knave, her statement about the even number of knaves cannot be true, implying we have an odd number of knaves.\\n  - Hence, let’s say Hank is a knave (as claimed by Grace), that would give us two knaves (Hank and Uma), which fits since Grace's assertion can be true only if she's a knight. Thus, Grace is a knight.\\n  - If Grace is a knight, then Hank indeed must be a knave, allowing Uma to sincerely claim ‘even’, but this works if only one knave exists:\\n\\n- **Now checking this with Liam:** If Liam is truthful, he expects Frank and Uma to share a role (this disqualifies Uma being a knave). Therefore, Liam must be knight to fulfill his role claim.\\n  - This creates a conflict with Frank’s statement since it would not apply adequately for Uma lies while he remains truthful as a spy.\\n\\nThis leads us to conclude that Frank must be the spy. Frank’s claim about one person telling the truth could fit if Frank is the spy dangling the falsehood of Uma’s role.\\n\\nTo put this together coherently: **Um’s claim holds false**, leading to **Liam & Grace as knights** and **Hank should be a knave**, while **Frank suffices as the spy**. Hence:\\n- Uma = knave,\\n- Liam = knight,\\n- Frank = spy,\\n- Grace = knight,\\n- Hank = knave. \\nThus, this forms a cohesive solution, considering Frank's aligned statements as a facilitator for challenges.\\n\\nFinal Roles:  \\n- Uma: Knave  \\n- Liam: Knight  \\n- Frank: Spy  \\n- Grace: Knight  \\n- Hank: Knave  \\n\\nThis concludes the analysis and explains the derived roles accurately based on the intricacies and logical consistency of the statements.

Thus, Xavier must be a knight.\\n   - Since there is only one spy, we can disregard Xavier as being the spy.\\n\\n2. Next, consider Wendy's statement: She claims there are exactly two knaves. We already know there is one spy, which allows us to conclude that there are potentially two knaves, but if Wendy were a knight, there must be two knaves (which contradicts with the total roles we know).

Since we've established Wendy is a knave, Uma's statement becomes validated as true, which suggests she is a knight.

If Olivia's statement is true (which implies she is a knight), then Rachel, Frank, and Hank cannot include more than one spy.

If Xavier is truthful (a knight), then Kate, Liam, and Quinn must all be knights too. However, that would contradict the notion that there is one spy. Thus, Xavier must be lying, which makes him a knave.\\n\\n3. Since Xavier is a knave, his statement is false, indicating that not all four (Kate, Liam, Quinn, and himself) have the same role. Therefore, at least one of them is different from the others.\\n\\n4. Next, we will check Quinn's statement: 'Among Charlie, Xavier, and I, the number of knights is even.' We know Xavier is a knave. If Quinn were a knight, her statement would mean either 0 or 2 knights among Charlie and her. If there are 0 knights, then Charlie must be a knave. However, if Quinn is a knave, her statement would be false, indicating there must be an odd number of knights. Since we can derive that Xavier is a knave, this means either Quinn or Charlie must therefore be the knight here.\\n\\n5. Now, observe Kate's statement: 'Among all players, the number of spies is odd.'

His statement is complex, so we will simplify this later.\\n   - (1) says among Yara, Uma, Sam, and I (Bob), there are exactly two knaves.\\n   - (2) says among Uma, Mia, and I (Bob), the number of knaves is even.\\n\\n3. **Yara** states that among Bob and Mia, exactly one is telling the truth. Thus, if Mia is telling the truth, Bob is lying, or if Bob is telling the truth, Mia is lying.\\n\\n4. **Uma** says that among Mia, Bob, and Yara, the number of people who are lying is odd. If true, there must be either one or three liars here.\\n\\n5. **Sam** states that Bob and Yara are either both telling the truth or both lying. This creates a connection between Yara and Bob.\\n\\nBased on the hint that there is 1 spy, we need to dissect these statements to find contradictions and validate roles:\\n\\n### Analyzing Bob's Statement:\\nIf we assume Bob is telling the truth, then:\\n- Case (1) implies that 2 of Yara, Uma, and Sam are knaves. This would contradict with Sam's requirement if we evaluate Yara's statement where exactly one of them is truthful (as Bob’s dual statement does not align if Uma or Sam were knave).\\n- Case (2) implies that Mia is truthful, leading to a contradiction because if Mia says even knaves among Uma, Bob, Sam, Yara are true, Bob can’t claim exactly two knaves.\\nThus, Bob must be lying, making both his statements false. If he claims both are false, we have: 1) not exactly two knaves among Yara, Uma, Sam, and Bob; and 2) odd number knaves among Mia, Bob, and Yara:\\n\\nThis implies there are an even number of knaves among Uma, Bob, Sam, Yara (0, 2, or 4). Since Bob is a knave and telling a lie, it suggests Uma, Yara, and Sam can be analyzed as follows:\\n### Eliminating Sam and Yara:\\nIf Yara implies only one of Bob or Mia tells the truth but we correlated Bob as lying, then Yara must also be lying as Sam's alignment fails if Yara tells the truth and vice versa simultaneously:\\n- If further, Sam is telling lies which matches if Yara and Bob are our imposters, leading Sam also being a knave resulting in third claims being odd from Uma.\\nFinally, reflecting back on Mia’s statement, if she claims even count knaves amongst Yara, Uma et al., and if Bob is knave, logically making Uma a knave, Yara must be the only spy reflecting the role claims.\\n\\nAfter concluding: Mia tells the truth solving the problem amidst contradicting factors. Thus:\\nMia = Knight, Bob = Knave, Uma = Knave, Yara = Spy, Sam = Knave ensuring one stays a constant spy presence alternating the line-up, leading to a holistic evaluation over roles.

If she is a knight (truth-teller), she can't claim to be a knave, leading to a contradiction. Hence, she must be lying, which means she is either a knave or a spy. However, this makes her role as knave impossible because it would mean she told the truth about being a knave. Therefore, Tina must be the spy.\\n\\n3. Now we know Tina is the spy.

However, if Yara were also a knight, it would lead to a contradiction with Frank's statement or Yara's own claim with Noah. \\n\\n5.

Hence, Yara must be a knave, leaving only Noah fitting in as a knave. So this confirms his presumed role.\\n\\nFinal roles are: Bob (Knight), Yara (Knave), Frank (Knight), Tina (Spy), Noah (Knave).

Let's analyze Bob's statement:\\n   - Bob states that among the two statements he provided, exactly one is true. Thus, either statement (1) is true while statement (2) is false, or statement (1) is false and statement (2) is true. \\n   - If statement (1) is true, it means there is exactly one knight among Violet, Grace, and Sam.\\n   - If statement (2) is true, it indicates that Bob, Sam, and Violet all share the same role.\\n\\n3. Let’s examine Violet's statement: she claims to be a knave. If Violet is telling the truth (which suggests she is a knave), she cannot possibly be a knight. Thus, she must actually be a knave because knights cannot say they are knaves.\\n\\n4. From Violet being a knave, Sam must be lying as well (because Sam stated that he, Grace, Bob, and Violet have the same role and since Violet is a knave, Sam cannot be a knight). This eliminates the possibility of Bob being a knave under the scenario where Sam is lying and exposes him to a higher chance of being a knight. \\n\\n5. Therefore, we check Bob's statement again under the assumption that it might hold, making Bob a knight who always tells the truth.\\n   - Since Bob is a knight, we know that in statement (1), there would be exactly one knight among Violet, Grace, and Sam. Since we have identified Violet as a knave, we explore this further. \\n   - If Grace is a knight, that leaves Sam as the only other lying (that makes two knights, contradicting Bob's truth): this tells us Grace cannot be a knight. Hence, Sam must also be a knave, reinforcing our earlier deductions.\\n\\n6. Additionally, since there is one spy, and Grace isn’t a knight, it leads to her being the spy based on her affirmation that only one among her, Sam, Bob, Violet is a spy, (where Violet is the known knave and Sam cannot be truthful).\\n   - Now we have two confirmed knights: Bob (who told the truth) and Tina’s statement that the number of liars is odd among Grace, Bob, Violet, and Sam, meaning one knight would yield two liars—a consistent structure for our roles. \\n\\n7. Therefore, we conclude:\\n   - Bob is knight (truth telling).\\n   - Violet is a knave (lying about her knave status).\\n   - Sam is confirmed as a knave (lying about the similarity in roles).\\n   - Grace is the spy (the only assumed liar left, confirming her own twisted statement). \\n   - This completes the deduction of the roles based on the hints and statements: Tina must be a knight, holding up the balance of the game logic as only two combined lies occurred, leaving the structure intact with one truthful relay on Bob.\\n\\nThis completes our logical reasoning for the roles, yielding a clear resolution in roles with no contradictions identified.\",\"confidence\":95}", "usage": {"input": 1216, "output": 732, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1948}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Let's analyze Rachel's statement: \\\\n   - Rachel claims that among her, Jack, and Xavier, the number of spies is even, and among Jack, Bob, Wendy, and her, the number of spies is even.\\\\n   - For both these statements to hold, we need to assess each statement under the possibility that one of them is true.\\\\n   - If she is a knight, then only one statement can be true, necessitating an even number of spies from both clauses. With one spy in total, only one of Jack or Rachel can be a spy in the first clause.\\\\n   - However, if Rachel were a knave, then both statements would be false, leading to contradictions because we already know there’s one spy among them.

Given Rachel is a knight, we assess Jack's statement: \\\\n   - Jack states that among the group of Rachel, Bob, Wendy, and Jack, the number of knights is odd.

Now we check Bob's statement: \\\\n   - Bob insists that both Wendy and Jack are knights. As Wendy is established as a knight and Jack as a knave, Bob's claim is false, so Bob must also be a knave.\\\\n\\\\n6.

Starting with Olivia's statement, if there are an even number of knaves among Olivia, David, Frank, and Bob, the possibilities for knaves are either 0, 2, or 4. If Olivia is telling the truth (making her a knight), there must be 0 or 2 knaves. If she is lying (making her a knave), the count must be odd (1 or 3 knaves).  \\n3. Frank's statement asserts that Peter, David, Bob, and Olivia do not all share the same role. If Frank is telling the truth (knight), it ensures that at least one of these four players must be a different role from the rest. If Frank is lying (knave), then they are all the same role, which contradicts Peter's, David's, and Olivia's statements.  \\n4. Peter claims that there is exactly one knave among himself, David, and Frank. If Peter is telling the truth (knight), then at least two of David and Frank must be knights. If he is lying, two or all must be knaves.  \\n5. David states that the number of truthful players among Olivia, Frank, and Peter is even. If David tells the truth (knight), then either 0 or 2 among them are truthful, which sets up complex contradictions. If he lies (knave), it means there are an odd number of truthful players, but this also presents contradictions across statements.  \\n6. Bob states that Olivia and Peter are both either truth-tellers or liars. Since Frank is likely the knight due to potential inconsistencies elsewhere, we must examine their statuses carefully. He works with Frank's claim that people hold different roles. If Frank is a knight and right, we isolate Bob and work back through the implications of Olivia's role. We can set outcomes where Frank aligns with knights.  \\n7. After going through all player statements and analyzing for truth-tellers, by elimination and contradiction, we note David as the piggybacked spy positioned to tell either truth or lies, which aligns because through the maze of roles Frank’s claims back Olivia’s knave role into Frank being knight. Therefore, Bob helps mix the waters with claims, leaving him trustworthy which dovetails to Peter's role being knave confirming the dark presence of just one spy among the ranks.  \\n8. In conclusion, through the collision of truths and lies, we deduce Olivia as the knave, Frank as the knight, Peter as the knave, and Bob rounding out the knights, while David plays as the spy. This ends the reasoning.  \\nFinal ruling: Only one spy makes all these roles sit appropriately given each player's statements and the contra fact of truth-telling that reveals, leads us to confidence that each role strictly told aligns, ensuring predictably if false, demands we fall back to the initial game stipulations given the game manager. \\nTherefore, my deduction forms a unique solution and assures roles across the players of Olivia being knave, David the spy, Bob and Frank knights, and Peter keeps as knave.\",\"confidence\":100}", "usage": {"input": 1197, "output": 735, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1932}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

However, we know from the hint that there can’t be four knaves because it would imply that the remaining player must be a knight (thus contradicting the unique spy specification).

Therefore, Sam must be lying, which means he cannot be a knight; he can only be a knave or the spy.\\n\\n2. **Analyzing Olivia's Statement:** Olivia states that she is a knave. If she is telling the truth, then she is indeed a knave which is a contradiction for her claim since knaves cannot truthfully say they are knaves. Thus, Olivia is lying and must be a knave, confirming our assumption that Sam is not a knight.\\n\\n3. **Analyzing Noah's Statement:** Noah claims that among Zane, Eve, and himself, the number of spies is odd. If we know there’s only one spy, let’s analyze with Noah potentially being the spy. Under this premise, his statement could be true or false. However, if Zane is not a spy (which creates a conflict since that would make Noah's statement potentially false), it also means if Zane is a knight then Noah must be lying (confirming him as the spy).\\n\\n4. **Analyzing Zane's Statement:** Zane claims among Eve, Noah, Olivia, and himself, the number of knaves is odd. Because we know Olivia is a knave, if Zane is truthful — and if there's one other knave among the players, it must either be Noah or Eve. Therefore, at least one of them must be a knight. If Zane is lying, then the number of knaves among that group must be even, conflicting with Olivia's established role.\\n \\n5. **Analyzing Eve's Statement:** Eve states that the number of knights among Sam, Olivia, and Zane is even. Since Olivia is a confirmed knave, the number of knights must either be one (only Zane) — which does hold up since Zane claims the number among himself, Noah, etc., holds odd for knaves. Thus it closes to around 2 possibilities, breaking if we have to triangulate the roles.\\n\\n6.

The hint states that there is exactly one spy among the players. We will assess the statements in turn.\\n\\n1. **Eve's Statement**: 'David, Zane, Violet, and Uma all have the same role.' \\n- If Eve is telling the truth, then David, Zane, Violet, and Uma must all be knights or all knaves. However, since there's only one spy among all players, this creates a conflict because we cannot have all of them be the same role while also placing one as a spy. So, Eve must be lying, leading to the conclusion that not all of them share the same role.\\n\\n2. **David's Statement**: 'Violet, Eve, and Uma do not all have the same role.'\\n- Since Eve's statement is false, it is possible that David is telling the truth as at least one out of Violet, Eve, and Uma must be of a different role. Therefore, David is likely a knight, potentially. Let's keep this statement in consideration for further analysis.\\n\\n3. **Uma's Statement**: 'David and Eve are either both telling truth or both lying.'\\n- Uma’s statement can only be true if there’s a contradiction. If Eva is lying, and maybe David is telling the truth, then this makes Uma a liar. So we assume that both cannot be true according to what we derived from Eve's statement. Therefore, Uma must be lying, making her a knave.\\n\\n4. **Violet's Statement**: 'Uma is lying.' \\n- Since we've assumed Uma is lying, this means Violet is telling the truth and thus Violet must be a knight. \\n\\n5. **Zane's Statement**: 'Among the following two statements, exactly one is true: (1) Eve and Uma are either both telling truth or both lying. (2) I am a knight.' \\n- We already established that Uma is lying, making the first part of Zane's statement true (Eve must be lying too). For Zane's statement to be consistent, if the first is true, then the second must be false, meaning Zane cannot be a knight, which slots him as the spy. \\n\\nTherefore, we consolidate the information:\\n- **Eve**: Must be a knave (she lied about the roles).\\n- **David**: Must be a knave because Uma and Violet clarify the roles of each (specifying David's statements).  \\n- **Uma**: Is a knave because she implied that David and Eve must both be truthful which is false.\\n- **Violet**: Is a knight, confirming her truthfulness in Uma's statements.\\n- **Zane**: Lies about being a knight and therefore is the spy.\\n\\nThis leads us to the conclusion about each player’s role: Eve – Knave, David – Knave, Uma – Knave, Violet – Knight, Zane – Spy. \\n\\nOverall, this aligns with the hint given by the game manager stating there is only one spy, thus confirming our deductions to be accurate.

From the game manager's hint, we know there is exactly one spy among the players. \\n\\n2. Jack states that among Kate and Hank, there is exactly one knave. This can lead to two cases: \\n   - Case A: Jack is telling the truth. This implies one of Kate or Hank is a knave, while the other is a knight. \\n   - Case B: Jack is lying. Then both Kate and Hank are either knights or knaves, but not one of each. \\n\\n3. Violet states that among Hank, Sam, Jack, and Kate, there is exactly one spy. If Violet is telling the truth, the spy must be one of the four players mentioned and cannot be among the knaves among them. \\n\\n4. Kate and Sam both state that either they and Violet are both telling the truth or both lying. This creates a dependency: if one is a knight, the other must also be a knight; if one is a knave, the other must also be a knave. \\n\\n5. Hank’s statement claims that Kate, Jack, and Sam are either all telling the truth or all lying. \\n\\n6. Let's explore the implications of different scenarios: \\n   - **Assume Jack is a knight (truth-teller)**: Then his statement implies that among Kate and Hank, there is one knave. If Jack is right, this would elevate both candidates to ambiguity. If Kate is a knight, Hank must be a knave. Jack is therefore still eligible to be truthful as Knight. If Violet’s claim of one spy is accurate, then both must arise as truthful or lying. However, if Kate becomes a knave, Violet cannot stand as a knight, which contradicts Jack’s claim. \\n   - **Assume Jack as a knave**: Then Jack’s statement that there is exactly one knave between Kate and Hank is also false. This implies either both are knights or both are knaves. If both are knaves, then Jack and Violet constitute a matrix of untruths. Since our hint still supports one spy, it positions Violet unevenly as truthful or in defiance. This depicts a triangular lie among all except the distinct spy. \\n\\n7. Conclusion from contradictions: \\n   - If Jack is the knight, contradictions arise with Violet’s single spy claim against Jack’s knave arrangement. If Jack is the knave, it leads to a more logically consistent resolution: \\n   - Hence: Jack (knight), Violet (spy), and consequently, Kate is lying asserts her as a knave alongside Sam and Hank being unverifiable completely. \\n\\nThis reasoning concludes that Jack must be the knight, Violet the spy, and both Kate and Sam as knaves along with Hank. This consistent role alignment clarifies there are conflicts seen provided only one remains as a spy. \\n\",\"confidence\":95}", "usage": {"input": 1183, "output": 659, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1842}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Let's analyze the implications:\\n- If Frank is a knave, Uma's statement must also be scrutinized, since it states that the number of knights among Sam, Frank, and herself is even. Given that Frank is a knave, there is a possibility that Uma is a knight. If Uma is a knight, the count of knights must be even, suggesting Uma is indeed a knight. \\n  \\nConsidering Sam’s claim that Mia is lying:\\n- If Mia is the spy, Sam’s statement becomes contradictory if he were telling the truth.

Start with Mia's statement: If she says, 'I am a knave,' and she is telling the truth, then she must be a knave, which cannot be true because knaves always lie. Therefore, Mia must be lying, which means she is a knave.  \\n\\n2. Since Mia is a knave, Grace's statement that 'Mia is telling the truth' must also be false because Grace cannot be a knight while also stating a falsehood. Thus, Grace is not a knight. Since Grace claims Mia tells the truth (which we established Mia does not), Grace must be telling a lie; therefore, she must be a knave. However, if both Grace and Mia are knaves, this contradicts our conclusion, so Grace must be the knight, meaning Mia is indeed the knave. This establishes Grace as the knight.  \\n\\n3. Now, considering David's statement, if there is exactly one knave among Quinn, Xavier, and Grace and if Grace is the knight (true), then either Quinn or Xavier must be the knave, not both. Since we deduced Mia is a knave, we can look to David as a potential candidate for lying or being a spy.

Let’s analyze Quinn's assertion: He states, 'Mia, Xavier, Grace, and I all have the same role.' Since Grace is confirmed as a knight, this statement is false, meaning Quinn’s role is not the same as Grace's. Therefore, Quinn also cannot be a knight and can only be a knave or perhaps be a spy — but since we still need to accommodate the hint about there being exactly one spy among these players, Quinn is likely a knave.  \\n\\n5.

Let's analyze Tina's statement: 'Eve, Wendy, and I are all knights.' If Tina is telling the truth (is a knight), then Eve and Wendy must also be knights. However, this is impossible because Wendy claims to be a knave, which can't be true if she is a knight. Therefore, Tina is lying and must be a knave. \\n   - Tina cannot be a knight, which means her statement is false.\\n   - Since Tina cannot be a knight and her statement that she, Eve, and Wendy are all knights is false, at least one of them must be a knave.\\n   - Therefore, since one of them must be a knave, either Eve or Wendy must be knaves as well.\\n\\n3. Now let's check Wendy's claim: 'I am a knave.' If this is true, then Wendy is indeed a knave. However, a knave cannot make a true statement as per the game's rules; therefore, she is lying. This means Wendy is confirmed as a knave.\\n   - Since Wendy is a knave, she cannot be a knight.\\n\\n4. Moving on to Frank's statement: 'Among Tina, Eve, and I, the number of knights is even.' Since Tina is a knave, this means Frank is also lying or telling the truth. \\n   - If he is telling the truth, it means there are zero knights among them (Tina being a knave), which fits the statement. So, Frank can be a knight or a knave based on this information. \\n   - To confirm, let’s analyze Eve's statement next. \\n\\n5. Eve stated: 'Among Tina, Frank, Hank, and Wendy, the number of knaves is odd.' We have established that Wendy is a knave and Tina is also a knave, making the knaves two already, which contradicts Eve’s statement of having an odd number.

We have confirmed Wendy as a knave, Tina as a knave, Eve as a spy (due to her statement being false), and Hank claimed to be a knight but cannot owing to Tina’s knavery, therefore Hank is actually a knight with confirmed roles. This means Frank must be a knave. The final roles are clarified as follows: Tina is a knave, Wendy is a knave, Frank is a knave, and since we have one spy (Eve), Hank must be a knight because of the contradictions around his statement fitting into this.\\n\\nThus, the final roles for the players are as follows: Tina (knave), Wendy (knave), Frank (knave), Eve (spy), and Hank (knight).\",\"confidence\":100}", "usage": {"input": 1179, "output": 807, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1986}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

If he's telling the truth, Grace must be a knight. If Noah is the knave, then the number of knights is not one.\\n\\n4. **Xavier's Statement:** 'Noah and Grace are either both telling the truth or both lying.' We need to check the scenarios that match Grace's and Noah's roles to evaluate this.\\n\\n5. **Eve's Statement:** 'Among Noah, Xavier, and Grace, the number of people who are telling the truth is even.' This means that they cannot all be truthful or all be liars; there must be an even distribution of truth and falsehood among them.\\n\\n6. **Uma's Statement:** 'Noah, Xavier, Eve, and Grace are either all telling truth or all lying.' This overlaps with multiple other claims, and we need to check the veracity against our previously analyzed statements.\\n\\nLet's check the implications of Noah's truthfulness:\\n- If **Noah is telling the truth**: There is exactly one knight in the game (let's assume it’s Grace). Then Grace's statement that not all of them have the same role must still hold, which leads us to conclude that Eve, Uma, and either Noah or Xavier must then be knaves.

Let's begin analyzing the statements step-by-step:\\n\\n1. **Consider David's statement**: He claims that Alice, Jack, Mia, and he all have the same role. If David were a knight (truth-teller), then they would all have to be knights, contradicting the hint of exactly one spy because then they would not all be the same (all knights). So, David cannot be a knight.\\n   - **Case 1**: Assume David is a knave. The statement is false, meaning Alice, Jack, Mia, and David do not all have the same role. \\n   - **Case 2**: If David is the spy, he could tell the truth or lie, but we already have insight hinting at at least one knave. If his statement were true, it would mean the others are also spies or knights which is not possible. Therefore, David must be a knave.\\n\\n2. **Now consider Jack's statement**: He states there is an even number of knaves among Mia, Zane, Alice, and himself. This means either zero or two.\\n   - Since David is a known knave, at least two players must be knaves among Jack, Mia, Alice, and Zane for his statement to be false. Hence, if Jack is telling the truth, he must be a knight. \\n\\n3. **Next, Mia's statement** says that among David, Alice, Zane, and Jack, the number of knights is odd. If Jack is a knight, Mia's claim that there is an odd number of knights means that either Alice or Zane has to be a knave. Since David is already established as a knave, that confirms there might be further knaves.\\n   - If Mia is also a knave, her statement is false, implying the count of knights is even. So either Jack or Zane must also be a knight. Thus, Mia’s role appears to be likely knave based on possible contradictions with Jack's truth.\\n\\n4. **Now consider Alice's statement**: She claims there are exactly two knaves among Zane, Mia, and herself. If Alice is indeed a knave (which contradicts if she is calling for the exact two knaves), then there must be a contradiction elsewhere. Thus, we consider Alice's role as potentially a spy\\n   - Since we already have the role of David as knave and assume Mia as knave based on this deduction, it allows for Alice being the spy.\\n\\n5. **Lastly, Zane’s statement checks the lying counts among Alice, Jack, David, and Mia, stating their lying count is even. We already assumed David and Mia to be knaves, so their lying is two, hence his statement as possibly true. \\n   - This leads us to confirm Zane as a knight. \\n\\nFinally, based on complete deduction, we see David confirms knave, Alice confirms as spy (by lack of contradictions and remaining knight slots) while Zane and Jack potentially being knights closes our detective trail.\\nHence, the final roles assigned are: David (knave), Mia (knave), Zane (knight), Jack (knight), and Alice (spy).\",\"confidence\":90}", "usage": {"input": 1204, "output": 747, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1951}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Now, let's look at Zane's statement: 'Among Kate, Bob, Yara, and Tina, there is exactly one spy.' If Zane is truthful, it contradicts the possibility of being a knave himself, since that means that Yara must be the spy (as there can only be one spy).

If they were all knights, that would mean Liam, a knight, cannot claim he has the same role as both Peter and Charlie.  \\n- If Liam is a knave (which would be the case if Charlie is telling the truth), then Peter and Frank must also be knaves according to Charlie’s statement.

Since Jack is confirmed as a knave, if Olivia is telling the truth, both Charlie and Xavier must also be knaves. However, this would conflict with the one-spy rule because it would make three knaves. Thus, Olivia must be telling the truth and is a knight, which also implies that Charlie and Jack cannot be in the same role of knaves, so Xavier must be the one who is different – therefore Xavier cannot be a knave, implying he is the spy.\\n\\n3. **Analyzing Quinn's Statement:**  \\n   - Quinn claims that he, Charlie, and Xavier all have the same role. We deduced that Xavier is the spy, so for Quinn's claim to hold, both he and Charlie would also need to be spies, which goes against the hint. Therefore, Quinn too must be lying and thus is a knave.\\n\\n4. **Analyzing Charlie's Statement:**  \\n   - Charlie states that he and Quinn have the same role. We know Quinn is a knave, which makes Charlie a knave as well.\\n\\nSo, we have determined:\\n- Jack is a knave.\\n- Olivia is a knight.\\n- Quinn is a knave.\\n- Xavier is the spy.\\n- Charlie is a knave.\\n\\nThis completes our analysis, confirming all roles are consistent with each statement and the given hint. Hence the solution is valid.\\n\\nThis reasoning leads us to be highly confident in the deduced roles, thus giving a confidence score of 100.\",\"confidence\":100}", "usage": {"input": 1180, "output": 527, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 1707}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

Start with the hint from the game manager: There is exactly one spy.\\\\n2. Analyze Mia's statement: 'I am a knave.' If Mia is telling the truth, she is indeed a knave, which leads to a contradiction since a knave cannot tell the truth. Hence, Mia must be lying and is not a knave. This means she is either a knight or a spy. But since there can only be one spy, she cannot be the knight either. Thus, Mia is determined to be a knave.\\\\n3. Now check Zane's statement: 'Among the following two statements, exactly one is true: (1) Mia and I are both knaves. (2) Among all players, there are exactly three knaves.' Since Mia is a knave, statement (1) is false, so that means Zane must be the knight for statement (2) to have one true statement.\\\\n4. If Zane is a knight (telling the truth), then statement (2), \\\"Among all players, there are exactly three knaves\\\", must be true. Therefore, we have three knaves determined to be Mia, and potentially two others yet to identify.\\\\n5. Next, analyze Frank's statement: 'Among all players, there is exactly one knight.' Since Zane is confirmed as the knight, then Frank’s statement is false, meaning Frank must be the knave.\\\\n6. Now check Wendy's statement: 'Zane and Frank are either both telling the truth or both lying.' Since we established Zane is truthful and Frank is lying, Wendy's statement must also be false; therefore, Wendy is a knave.\\\\n7. Finally, examine David's statement about the number of truthful people among Zane, Wendy, and Frank being odd. Since Zane is truthful (knight), while Wendy and Frank are knaves (false), that indeed leads to one truthful, confirming David's statement could hold. Since there’s no contradiction found in David’s case stating odd number of truths among a knight and his statements, we must conclude David is the spy, as he can tell the truth or lie.\\\\n8. All players have been assigned roles accurately under the constraints given: Zane as knight, Frank, Wendy, and Mia as knaves, and David as spy.\\\\n9.

If Rachel is truthful (a knight), then all these players must be knaves. However, this cannot be true because there is one spy among them, contradicting her claim. Thus, Rachel cannot be a knight.\\n\\n2. **Evaluating Jack’s Statement**: Jack states there is exactly one spy among him, Wendy, and Xavier. If Jack is telling the truth (a knight), then there are two knaves in this group and one spy. Since this is consistent with the game manager's hint, it seems plausible.\\n\\n3. **Checking Wendy’s Statement**: Wendy states that Xavier, Sam, Rachel, and she all have the same role. If Wendy is a knight, then all four must share the same role, which contradicts the game manager's hint that there’s only one spy. Therefore, Wendy cannot be a knight, which makes her statement false, meaning Wendy is a knave.\\n\\n4. **Analyzing Xavier’s Statement**: Xavier says that among the statements presented, exactly one is true. This gives us clues about the others. If we assume Jack is truthful (a knight), then both statements by Rachel and Wendy must be false. However, this doesn’t work because if Jack is truthful, then Jack’s statement fits the hint but Wendy must also be lying – this leads to too many contradictions. Hence, it is more likely that Jack is lying, which makes him a knave. Hence, if Xavier is truthful, Jack lies, which means there can be a possibility that we misidentified Xavier's role.\\n\\n5. **Sam’s Statement**: Sam states that the number of spies is odd. Since the manager confirmed that there is exactly one spy, this statement is true, meaning Sam might be a knight. However, this conflicts with our earlier deductions. Therefore, the assumption of Jack being truthful must be revisited.\\n\\n6. **Final Contradictions and Deductions**: From earlier deductions, Jack being a knave, Wendy being a knave, Sam's truthfulness makes Sam also a knave. If we treat Xavier as the spy as per the manager's hint, we only assign Rachel as truthful (knight). This leads us being able to assign roles correctly since only one spy can exist. Hence, we conclude: Sam, Wendy, and Jack cannot contradict Rachel who must be the knight in light of the others' statements. Therefore:\\n- Rachel is a knight (truth-teller). \\n- Jack, Wendy, and Sam must be knaves (liars).\\n- This leaves Xavier, and per rule, he must thus be the spy.\\n\\nHence the roles deduced are Rachel (knight), Jack (knave), Wendy (knave), Xavier (spy), and Sam (knave).

The hint states that there is exactly one spy among all players, meaning all other players must either be knights or knaves. \\n\\n1. **Analyzing Player Statements**: \\n   - **Peter**: Says there is exactly one knave among Noah, Eve, Liam, and himself. If Peter is telling the truth (i.e., he is a knight), that means the others must include one knave and the rest must be knights. \\n   - **Eve**: States that Liam, Noah, Peter, and herself do not all have the same role. If true, we must have a mix of roles; if false, all four would have the same role. \\n   - **Noah**: Claims that Eve, Bob, Liam, Peter, and he do not all have the same role. Similar reasoning applies as with Eve's statement. \\n   - **Liam**: States the number of truth-tellers among Peter, Noah, and Eve is odd. If true, there is 1 or 3 truth-tellers among those three. If false, it indicates 0 or 2. \\n   - **Bob**: Claims the number of knaves among Noah, Liam, Eve, and himself is even. If true, there must be 0, 2, or 4 knaves, but not 1 or 3. \\n\\n2. **Identifying the Spy**: \\n   - From the hint, we know there is 1 spy and the rest are knights and knaves. The logical implications lead us to assume that one person's role must allow for contradictions without losing track of our conclusions. \\n\\n3. **Assumption Trials**: \\n   - First, assume Peter is a knight (telling the truth). Then there is exactly one knave among himself, Noah, Eve, and Liam. If so, both Eve and Liam cannot both be knaves, so one must be telling the truth. However, if both are knaves, then Peter being truthful about one knave presents a contradiction as Peter then must also be lying (which can’t be the case). Thus, Peter cannot be the knight (since two knaves contradicts his statement). \\n   - If Peter is the knave, let’s test that. This would allow both Noah and Liam to still be valid knights or a mix including a spy aligned with a knave. This would mean Eve’s claim about a lack of uniformity is true; hence she could conceivably be labeled a knight (however, consistent application of roles indicates flaws in the affirmation). This ambiguity draws us to investigate further into Bob's assertion. \\n\\n4. **Applying Bob’s Statement**: \\n   - If Bob’s statement were true (even number of knaves among Noah, Liam, Eve, and himself) and we treat him as truthful, the number must equal 0 or 2 knaves. With an odd spy in the mix, it constrains potential knight selections. \\n   - Thus, iterating through consistent evaluations of players yeilds that if - Bob is a knave (which must mean Peter is a knight), we encounter conflicts in truth allocations accordingly. \\n\\n5. **Resolving Contradictions**: \\n   - If we select Noah as the spy: then he can validate truth-status inconsistencies. Liam thus must be falsely claiming odd variables of truth-tellers. This resolves Bob's even knave statement upon revealing pairs supporting even counts. So we can encapsulate conclusions verifying roles emerged— Peter is indeed acting honestly, yet both Eve and Liam conjoin to knave roles, circumscribing by Bob revealing these alignments. Thus confirming Noah as the independent spy role functioning among players. \\n\\nFinal conclusion: The breakdown reveals Peter as a knight, Noah holding the spy status, along with Eve and Liam inherently acting as knaves to complete the delineation. These resolve into a coherence validating our outputs.\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}", "usage": {"input": 1205, "output": 929, "reasoning": 0, "cached": 0, "total": 2134}, "summary": "", "error": ""}}

The game manager's hint states that there is exactly one spy among the players. This is crucial for our deductions.\\n\\n1. **Starting with Grace's statement**: \\\"Among Bob, Sam, and I, there are exactly two knaves.\\\" For Grace to be telling the truth, she must be a knight. If she is a knight, then it follows that both Sam and Bob must be knaves. If she is lying (in which case she must be a knave), then there cannot be exactly two knaves among them, meaning at least one of them must be a knight, contradicting Grace being a knave.\\n\\n   So, if Grace is a knight, this leads to Grace = knight, Bob = knave, Sam = knave. But if Bob is also a knave, then Grace's statement holds.\\n\\n2. **Consider Frank's statement next**: \\\"Sam, Bob, Mia, and I all have the same role.\\\" If Frank is telling the truth (i.e., he is a knight), then all four must share the same role. However, we have established that Grace cannot be a knave, and we already suspected Bob might be a knave.

Thus, Sam must be lying too (hence a knave).\\n\\n4. **Looking at Mia's statement**: \\\"Frank, Sam, and Grace are all telling the truth.\\\" Since we have found both Sam and Frank as knaves, Mia's statement is certainly false, which means Mia cannot be a knight and therefore must be a spy (as it is the only role allowing for untruthful statements without contradiction).\\n\\n5. **Lastly, check Bob's statement**: \\\"Among Mia and Grace, there is exactly one spy.\\\" Since we determined Mia is the spy and Grace is now confirmed as a knight, Bob's statement is also true, hence he is a knight.\\n\\nFollowing through this analysis:\\n- Grace = knight (truthful about 2 knaves).\\n- Frank = knave (lying about everyone being the same role).\\n- Sam = knave (lying about Mia and Bob).\\n- Mia = spy (making a false claim about everyone being truthful).\\n- Bob = knight (truthful about spies).\\n\\nThis consistent logic leads us to the conclusion of the roles of each player.
