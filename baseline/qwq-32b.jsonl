Since Mia is a spy, (1) is false. For Zane's statement to hold, (2) must be true if he is a knight. However, assuming Zane is a knight leads to a contradiction: (2) requires three knaves, but Frank (if a knave) would make his false claim 'exactly one knight' conflict with Zane being the only knight. Thus, Zane must be a knave, making his entire statement false. Therefore, both (1) and (2) are false. Since (1) is already false, (2) being false means there are not three knaves.\\n\\n3. **Frank's statement**: 'Exactly one knight.' If Frank were a knight, this would require only himself as the knight, forcing Zane, Wendy, and David to be knaves. This would create three knaves (contradicting Zane's false (2)), so Frank must be a knave. His false statement means knights exceed one.\\n\\n4. **Wendy's statement**: 'Zane and Frank are either both truthful or both lying.' Since Zane and Frank are both knaves (lying), Wendy's statement is true, making her a knight.\\n\\n5. **David's statement**: 'Among Zane, Wendy, and Frank, the truthful count is odd.' Only Wendy (a knight) is truthful here, so the count is 1 (odd). Thus, David must be a knight.\\n\\n**Final Roles**: Zane (knave), Frank (knave), Wendy (knight), David (knight), Mia (spy).

However, Frank's statement ('Sam, Bob, Mia, and I all have the same role') would force all four to be Knights or Spies, conflicting with Grace's statement (which would require two knaves among Bob, Sam, and herself if she were truthful). Thus, Mia must be lying (Knave or Spy).\\n\\n3. If Mia were the Spy, her lie would mean at least one of Frank, Sam, or Grace is lying. Frank's claim would fail (since Mia is a Spy), making Frank a Knave. Sam's claim ('Mia and Bob share a role') would require Bob to also be a Spy (impossible), so Sam must be a Knave. Grace's statement would then require two knaves among Bob, Sam, and herself. If Grace were truthful (Knight), Bob would have to be a Knave, but his statement ('exactly one spy among Mia and Grace') would then be true, contradicting his Knave role.
